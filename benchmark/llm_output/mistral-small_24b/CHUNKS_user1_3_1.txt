The performance of different models like CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Atlas-11B can vary significantly across different tasks, including fact verification tasks like FEVER. Several factors could contribute to why CoRAG underperforms on FEVER compared to Atlas-11B despite superior results in other domains:

1. **Task-Specific Adaptation**: Models like Atlas-11B might be specifically fine-tuned or adapted for the FEVER dataset, which involves verifying claims against a large corpus of evidence. This task-specific adaptation can lead to better performance on fact verification tasks.

2. **Retrieval Mechanism**: CoRAG relies heavily on its retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents from a large corpus before generating answers. If the retrieval component is not well-tuned for the FEVER dataset, it might fail to retrieve the most relevant evidence, leading to poor performance in generating accurate verifications.

3. **Complexity of Evidence**: The FEVER dataset often requires complex reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence. CoRAG's generation process might struggle with integrating and reasoning over this evidence compared to models like Atlas-11B that are better equipped for such tasks.

4. **Model Architecture**: Different architectures have different strengths. For instance, Atlas-11B might have a more robust architecture or additional components (like specialized layers) that enhance its performance on fact verification tasks.

5. **Training Data and Pre-training**: The pre-training data and fine-tuning strategies used for these models can significantly impact their performance. If Atlas-11B was trained on datasets similar to FEVER, it would have an advantage in understanding the nuances of fact verification.

6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Different evaluation metrics might favor one model over another. For example, if the FEVER dataset's evaluation metric heavily penalizes certain types of errors that CoRAG is more prone to making, this could result in lower performance scores for CoRAG.

7. **Contextual Understanding**: Fact verification often requires a deep understanding of context and nuanced language. If Atlas-11B has better contextual understanding capabilities or is better at handling the specific linguistic challenges presented by FEVER, it would perform better.

These factors suggest that there are indeed task-specific limitations in fact verification. Models like CoRAG might excel in tasks where retrieval and generation are crucial but struggle when the task requires complex reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence. This highlights the importance of tailoring models to specific tasks and understanding their strengths and weaknesses in different contexts.
