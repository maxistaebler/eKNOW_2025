CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a multi-modal retrieval-based approach designed to enhance multi-hop reasoning tasks. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with generating coherent responses that span multiple hops of information, where each hop represents retrieving and leveraging context from different sources or documents to derive the final output. CoRAG addresses this by improving the ability to fetch necessary context at each hop, thereby facilitating more accurate and comprehensive multi-hop reasoning.

In traditional RAG architectures, if there is a limitation in the retrieval stage—such as missing relevant documents or suboptimal document selection—the model may not be able to retrieve adequate context needed for subsequent hops. This can lead to generating nonsensical or irrelevant responses during the generation process because the system lacks reliable data support at each step of reasoning.

CoRAG overcomes this issue by employing a more sophisticated retrieval mechanism that dynamically selects and retrieves relevant documents based on the current hop's requirements, thus improving accuracy and relevance across multiple hops. This dynamic context selection ensures that each subsequent hop has access to the best possible contextual information needed for generating an appropriate response.

In summary, CoRAG fundamentally differentiates itself from traditional RAG architectures by enhancing its retrieval capabilities at each multi-hop reasoning stage, thereby mitigating the specific limitations associated with document availability and relevance in previous approaches.
