The data tables provided do not contain any information relevant to answering the question regarding why CoRAG (likely an abbreviation for a specific model or dataset) might underperform on FEVER (a fact validation dataset). The available datasets only include details about research projects related to ByteDance and their involvement in the PaSa Project. Without additional data specifically concerning the performance of models like CoRAG on the FEVER benchmark, it is impossible to determine if there are task-specific limitations or other underlying factors contributing to its underperformance.

To provide a more accurate analysis, one would need data references that explicitly compare the performance metrics of CoRAG and Atlas-11B on various fact verification benchmarks. Such comprehensive data could reveal insights into whether these models exhibit consistent strengths or weaknesses across different types of tasks and datasets, potentially offering clues about their relative limitations.

For example, if there were detailed records [Data: FEVER (5), 2023 Benchmark Analysis (6-14); Model Comparison Studies (18, 22, +more)], one could draw conclusions based on a broader spectrum of model comparisons and performance evaluations. However, as provided, the response must remain speculative without access to specific comparative data for CoRAG and Atlas-11B on FEVER.

In summary, while the current dataset does not support any such analysis, further investigation into model-specific performance metrics would be required to address this query comprehensively.
