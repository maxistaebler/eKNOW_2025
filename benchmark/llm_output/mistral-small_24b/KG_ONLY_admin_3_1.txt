The performance of different models like CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Atlas-11B can vary significantly across different tasks, including fact verification tasks like FEVER. Several factors could contribute to why CoRAG underperforms on FEVER compared to Atlas-11B despite showing superior results in other areas:

1. **Task-Specific Adaptation**: Models like Atlas-11B might be specifically fine-tuned or adapted for the FEVER dataset, which involves verifying claims against a large corpus of evidence. CoRAG, while effective in other tasks, may not have undergone the same level of task-specific adaptation.

2. **Retrieval Mechanism**: CoRAG relies on a retrieval mechanism to augment its generation capabilities with relevant context from an external database. If this retrieval mechanism is not optimized for the specific types of claims and evidence in FEVER, it could lead to suboptimal performance.

3. **Complexity of Evidence**: The FEVER dataset often requires complex reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence. CoRAG's architecture might struggle with integrating and reasoning over these pieces of evidence as effectively as Atlas-11B, which may have a more robust mechanism for handling such complexity.

4. **Model Size and Capacity**: Atlas-11B is a larger model (with 11 billion parameters) compared to many other models. Larger models generally have more capacity to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, which could be crucial for tasks like fact verification that require nuanced understanding and reasoning.

5. **Training Data and Pre-training**: The pre-training objectives and datasets used for Atlas-11B might include more diverse and relevant information for fact verification compared to those used for CoRAG. This can lead to better performance on tasks like FEVER.

6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Different models might be evaluated using different metrics or criteria, which could affect their perceived performance. For example, if Atlas-11B is optimized for a specific metric that aligns well with the FEVER evaluation criteria, it might appear to perform better.

These factors suggest that there are indeed task-specific limitations in fact verification. Models like CoRAG, while powerful and versatile, may not be inherently suited to all tasks without additional fine-tuning or adaptation. This highlights the importance of tailoring models to specific tasks and datasets to achieve optimal performance.
