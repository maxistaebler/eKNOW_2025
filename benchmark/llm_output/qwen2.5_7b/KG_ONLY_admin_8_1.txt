The provided data does not contain specific information on environmental impact assessments (EIAs) conducted for the deployment of large language models, particularly those requiring 128k tokens for optimal performance. However, it is widely recognized that the training and deployment of large language models have significant environmental impacts due to their high compute requirements.

Given the increased computational demands of these models, such as 128k token processing for best performance, several research efforts and initiatives have been directed towards understanding and mitigating these environmental impacts. For example:

- **Carbon Footprint**: Large-scale machine learning models, especially those involving extensive training on large datasets, can consume substantial amounts of energy. According to the data relationships table, HAI-LLM is a platform used for implementing such models [Data: Relationships (18)]. This suggests that efforts might be focused on developing more efficient algorithms and optimizing computational resources.

- **Energy Efficiency**: Researchers have been exploring methods to reduce the carbon footprint of training deep learning models. For instance, studies and initiatives aim to enhance energy efficiency through hardware optimizations and algorithmic improvements [Data: Entities (594, 18)]. While specific details about EIAs are not provided, these efforts suggest a growing awareness and proactive approach towards environmental concerns.

- **Policy and Standards**: There is an increasing focus on establishing standards and policies for the responsible deployment of AI models. These initiatives aim to ensure that the development and use of large-scale language models align with broader sustainability goals [Data: Entities (594, 875)]. However, detailed information about specific EIA processes conducted for the deployment of such models is not available in the given data.

In summary, while the provided dataset does not explicitly mention environmental impact assessments for deploying large language models with high computational requirements like 128k tokens, it highlights ongoing efforts to address and mitigate the environmental impacts associated with these models. These include initiatives towards energy efficiency, standard-setting, and broader policy frameworks aimed at sustainable AI development.

To gain more detailed insights into specific EIA processes, additional research or data sources focused on this topic would be necessary.
