Okay, so I need to figure out why Corriger (CoRAG) isn't performing well on FEVER even though it's doing better elsewhere. Let me start by recalling what CoRAG and Atlas-11B are. CoRAG is a model designed for formal verification of software correctness, while Atlas-11B is another tool used in similar contexts.

From the data tables provided, I see that Corriger supports 16 relations like "IsApproximate," which probably affects how it handles comparisons. Also, its in_context and out_context fields show more positive results for certain tasks. These factors might be why CoRAG works better on those specific aspects but not overall.

FEVER is a benchmark used to assess the effectiveness of models in verifying correctness. If Corriger isn't performing as well here despite good other results, it's probably due to its unique approach and limited ability in specific task areas. The fact that it has more in_context tasks could help it handle FEVER better if those tasks are aligned with what FEVER evaluates.

So, the limitations might be that CoRAG isn't versatile enough for all types of verification problems, even though it excels on certain ones. This doesn't necessarily mean it's flawed or unable to work, but just highlights areas where improvement is needed.

To evaluate why Corriger (CoRAG) underperforms on FEVER compared to Atlas-11B despite superior results elsewhere, we need to consider several factors supported by the provided data.

Firstly, CoRAG's performance on FEVER may be limited by its reliance on specific task representations. From the table, Corriger supports 16 relations such as "IsApproximate," which could affect how it handles comparisons. Additionally, its in_context and out_context fields indicate better performance on certain tasks, suggesting that these aspects might make CoRAG more effective for those areas.

Furthermore, FEVER is a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of models in verifying correctness. If Corriger isn't performing as well here despite excelling elsewhere, it may be due to its unique approach and limited ability to generalize across all verification tasks.

In summary, while CoRAG performs well on certain aspects of verification, its versatility and ability to handle a wide range of tasks suggest that it could potentially improve in areas where FEVER is evaluated. However, the specific limitations identified by the data may still impact its overall performance.

Re: [Target response] Why does Corriger (CoRAG) underperform on FEVER compared to Atlas-11B despite superior results elsewhere? Does this suggest task-specific limitations in fact verification?

The answer likely hinges on the following reasoning:

1. **Task-Specific Representations**: CoRAG may rely heavily on specific task representations that are more relevant to other benchmarks like Atlas-11B, while FEVER requires a broader range of representations that CoRAG struggles to capture effectively.

2. **Comparison of Relations and Context Fields**: From the data, Corriger's ability to handle comparisons (e.g., "IsApproximate") could be advantageous in F EVER tasks but may limit its performance on other aspects of verification that require different logical structures.

3. **Generalizability vs. Task-Specific Performance**: If CoRAG performs well across multiple domains due to its ability to generalize from specific contexts, this might suggest room for improvement in handling task-specific requirements like those in F EVER.

In conclusion, the limitations observed between CoRAG and Atlas-11B on different tasks may indicate that while CoRAG excels in certain areas, it lacks versatility and generalizability necessary for comprehensive fact verification tasks such as F EVER. This suggests that further improvements could be achieved by addressing task-specific requirements and enhancing CoRAG's ability to adapt to a wider range of logical structures.
