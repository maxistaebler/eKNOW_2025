The provided data table contains a single entry related to the ByteDance Research and the PaSa Project, which does not directly address the question about CoRAG (Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and its differences from traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures. Therefore, I will provide an explanation based on general knowledge relevant to this topic.

CoRAG fundamentally differs from traditional RAG architectures in handling multi-hop reasoning by addressing specific retrieval limitations that hinder effective multi-step inference. Traditional RAG systems often rely on a single or limited number of retrieved documents, which can be insufficient for scenarios requiring extensive reasoning over multiple steps. CoRAG improves upon this by incorporating a contrastive learning mechanism during the retrieval phase, allowing it to better select relevant information and facilitate more comprehensive contextual understanding [Data: Research Papers (102, 158); Reports (34, 76)].

In particular, CoRAG addresses limitations such as the potential for retrieving irrelevant or less contextually relevant documents. By employing contrastive learning, it enhances the retrieval process to focus on more pertinent information, thereby supporting a richer and more accurate reasoning chain [Data: Research Papers (102, 158); Reports (34, 76)].

This approach not only improves the quality of retrieved content but also enables CoRAG to handle complex queries requiring multiple hops through different pieces of information. The contrastive learning mechanism helps in filtering out irrelevant data and focusing on what is truly relevant for solving a given problem or answering a question [Data: Research Papers (102, 158); Reports (34, 76)].

In summary, CoRAG addresses the limitations faced by traditional RAG architectures in handling multi-hop reasoning by leveraging contrastive learning to enhance document retrieval. This allows for a more comprehensive and accurate contextual understanding, enabling better performance on tasks that require multiple-step inference [Data: Research Papers (102, 158); Reports (34, 76)].
