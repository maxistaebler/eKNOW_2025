The inconsistency in performance between different datasets and models can be influenced by various factors. Let's break down some potential explanations for the observed behavior:

### 1. **Data Distribution Differences:**
   - **HotpotQA/2WikiMultihopQA:** These datasets are known to have a similar type of structure, often involving complex question answering that requires deeper reasoning and navigating through multiple hops or steps.
   - **Bamboogle:** This dataset might differ significantly in terms of the complexity and diversity of its questions, which could make it more challenging for models with strong performance on other datasets. For example, Bamboogle could include a wider variety of question types, different domains, or a higher level of ambiguity.

### 2. **Model Complexity:**
   - **EM Score Improvements:** The improvements in EM score (often used to measure the effectiveness of question-answering systems) on HotpotQA/2WikiMultihopQA could indicate that these models are particularly adept at handling complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
   - **Inconsistent Performance on Bamboogle:** Models might struggle more with datasets where the questions require a different set of skills or have fewer constraints. For instance, if Bamboogle includes many simpler, direct-answers questions (where the model can directly map from the question to an answer), models that excel in multi-hop reasoning might not perform as well.

### 3. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning:**
   - **Training Data:** The training data for Search-o1-32B might be more aligned with the types of questions Bamboogle includes, or it might have been fine-tuned on similar datasets.
   - **Fine Tuning Strategies:** Different models might have different strategies for fine-tuning. Models that are specifically trained to handle multi-hop reasoning could struggle if their training data does not include such complex tasks.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics and Dataset Design:**
   - **Evaluation Criteria:** The evaluation criteria used in HotpotQA/2WikiMultihopQA might be more aligned with the types of questions they contain, making them effective.
   - **Dataset Diversity:** Bamboogle might have a different design or structure that does not align well with traditional multi-hop reasoning datasets.

### 5. **Model Architecture and Mechanisms:**
   - **Mechanism of Reasoning:** Some models might excel in mechanisms like pointer networks, which are particularly adept at handling direct-answer tasks but struggle with complex reasoning.
   - **Attention Mechanisms:** Attention mechanisms vary widely across different architectures. If Search-o1-32B uses a specific type or strength of attention that better suits the types of questions in Bamboogle, it might perform better.

### 6. **Model Capacity and Overfitting:**
   - **Capacity Issues:** There could be an issue with model capacity where Search-o1-32B is overfitted to the training data of HotpotQA/2WikiMultihopQA.
   - **Generalization:** Models trained on one type of dataset might generalize poorly to another, especially if the datasets have different underlying distributions.

### Conclusion:
To address this inconsistency, it's crucial to understand how models are performing across various metrics and types of questions. Identifying what specific aspects of the model (architecture, training data) align with or conflict with the types of tasks found in Bamboogle would be essential for improving performance on such datasets.
