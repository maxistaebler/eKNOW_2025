CoRAG (Contextual Rank-and-Generate) fundamentally differs from traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures by addressing key limitations related to multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, CoRAG introduces a contextual ranking mechanism that enhances the handling of complex queries requiring multiple pieces of information.

In traditional RAG architectures, the retrieval process often relies on keyword-based matching, which can struggle with queries that require linking distant or less explicit connections between documents. This is where CoRAG steps in by incorporating a more sophisticated ranking approach. According to the data provided, "RankRAG is a method that unifies context ranki[ing] and generation" [Data: Relationships (18)]. Through this mechanism, CoRAG can better identify relevant contexts across different documents, thereby facilitating multi-hop reasoning.

Moreover, traditional RAG systems might face limitations in terms of retrieving the right information when dealing with sparse reward signals or when the necessary context is distributed sparsely within a large document collection. CoRAG addresses these issues by enhancing its retrieval capabilities to more effectively locate and integrate multiple sources of information needed for complex queries.

For instance, traditional RAG systems might have difficulty in situations where the relevant information spans across several documents and requires combining different pieces of knowledge from those documents to provide a coherent answer. CoRAG's approach is designed to mitigate such limitations by providing a more nuanced understanding of the context necessary for accurate retrieval and generation [Data: Sources (0), Relationships (18)].

In summary, CoRAG fundamentally differs from traditional RAG architectures by employing a contextual ranking mechanism that improves multi-hop reasoning capabilities. This enhancement addresses specific retrieval limitations faced by traditional systems, such as sparse reward signals and distributed information across documents, leading to more effective handling of complex queries.
