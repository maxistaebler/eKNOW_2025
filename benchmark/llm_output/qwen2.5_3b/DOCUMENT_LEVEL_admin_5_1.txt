The statement suggests that the performance gains observed in CoRAG (a retrieval-Augmented Generative model) are consistent across different retriever models, specifically between a smaller model (E5-base) and a larger one (E5-large). This consistency implies that the framework might be less dependent on or beneficial for very weak retrievers.

To elaborate further:

1. **Consistency Across Retrievers**: If CoRAG's gains are consistent across different retriever models, it suggests that the model is robust to differences in retrieval quality, whether high-quality (e.g., E5-large) or low-quality (e.g., E5-base).

2. **Compensatory Effect vs. Synergistic Effect**:
   - **Compensatory Effect**: If CoRAG compensates for weak retrievers by making up for their shortcomings, it implies that its core abilities are more adaptive and robust to less reliable retrieval support.
   - **Synergistic Effect**: On the other hand, if CoRAG significantly benefits from strong retriever models, the gains would be greater when paired with high-quality retrieval.

Since we observe consistent performance across both types of retrievers, it suggests that the framework is more compensatory rather than synergistic. This consistency indicates that while a very weak retriever might not help much (as expected), CoRAG still maintains good performance regardless of whether it has strong or weak retrieval assistance.

However, this observation alone does not rule out any potential effects. It simply provides context to how the model behaves under different conditions. Further analysis would be needed to determine if there are any underlying mechanisms or specific behaviors in the retriever-assisted generation process that contribute to these consistent gains.
