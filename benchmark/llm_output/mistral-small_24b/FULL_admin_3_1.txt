The performance of models like CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Atlas-11B can vary significantly across different tasks, including fact verification. Several factors could contribute to why CoRAG underperforms on the FEVER dataset compared to Atlas-11B:

1. **Task-Specific Adaptations**: Atlas-11B might have been specifically fine-tuned or adapted for fact verification tasks, which could give it an edge over models like CoRAG that are more general-purpose.

2. **Data Characteristics**: The FEVER dataset has unique characteristics, such as the need to verify claims against a large corpus of evidence documents. If CoRAG's retrieval and generation mechanisms are not optimized for this specific type of data, it could lead to underperformance.

3. **Retrieval Quality**: CoRAG relies heavily on its ability to retrieve relevant context from a large database. If the retrieval mechanism is not effective in pulling out the most pertinent information for fact verification tasks, it can hinder performance.

4. **Generation Accuracy**: Even if CoRAG retrieves good context, its generation component might struggle with producing accurate and coherent verifications. This could be due to limitations in the model's ability to understand and generate text that aligns with the specific requirements of fact verification.

5. **Model Size and Complexity**: Atlas-11B is a larger model (11 billion parameters) compared to CoRAG, which might give it more capacity to handle complex tasks like fact verification. Larger models often have better generalization capabilities and can capture more nuanced patterns in the data.

6. **Training Data and Objectives**: The training objectives and datasets used for fine-tuning these models could differ significantly. If Atlas-11B was trained on a dataset that closely resembles FEVER, it would likely perform better on this task compared to CoRAG.

These factors suggest that there are indeed task-specific limitations in fact verification. Models like CoRAG might excel in tasks where retrieval and generation of context are crucial but struggle when the task requires precise and accurate verification against a large corpus of evidence. This highlights the importance of tailoring models and their training processes to specific tasks for optimal performance.
