Okay, I need to figure out whether if CoRAG's gains continue across different retriever qualities like E5-base vs E5-large, it implies compensation from the weaker retrievers or if they work together. 

First, I remember that CoRAG stands for "CoRRAsble Retrieval Graph Aggregation," and its benefits are known to extend beyond the base model in some cases. So this suggests that having multiple models working together can enhance performance.

But why would extending CoRAG's gains mean compensation? Maybe because each retriever has different strengths, so when you have more of them, they cover different aspects or handle different parts of the task better. This complementary effect makes sense because in tasks where a strong model is needed for accuracy, you might use a larger version to get better performance.

I'm not sure if this compensation implies that both models work together or if one can compensate for the other. Maybe it's about the overall system architectureâ€”using more models increases diversity and coverage, which benefits all tasks rather than just some.

So, putting it all together, CoRAG gains with extended versions likely mean better diversity and coverage across different retrievers, leading to synergistic benefits without needing all of them for a strong performance.

It is plausible that if **CoRAG's gains** persist across multiple retriever qualities (e.g., E5-base vs. E5-large), it might imply a compensatory relationship between the weaker retrievers and the stronger ones rather than a direct synergy. 

### Key Considerations:

1. **Interplay Between Weaker and Stronger Retrieval Models**:  
   - When extending **CoRAG** to include larger models (e.g., E5-large instead of just E5-base), there may be opportunities for these models to "compensate" or enhance the performance of weaker retrievers. For instance, a larger model might handle tasks that require more extensive reasoning or context that is not fully captured by smaller models.

2. **Diverse Strengths in Retrieval Models**:  
   - Retrieval models like E5 have varying strengths and limitations. While E5-base may be sufficient for many tasks, the introduction of larger versions (e.g., E5-large) can provide additional coverage or efficiency, particularly when combined with CoRAG's benefits.

3. **Complementary Benefits of CoRAG**:  
   - By incorporating multiple retrievers within CoRAG, the system can benefit from diverse perspectives and task requirements. This interplay might naturally lead to a "compensatory" relationship where weaker retrievers contribute to the overall performance when combined with stronger ones.

4. **Performance Across Tasks**:  
   - If extending CoRAG's gains hold true across different retriever qualities, it could suggest that the system is leveraging complementary strengths from smaller and larger models. This interdependence might mean that weak retrievers are utilized effectively within the framework to enhance performance without requiring all models for optimal results.

### Conclusion:

The suggestion that CoRAG's gains persist across retriever qualities (E5-base vs. E5-large) imply a compensatory relationship between weaker and stronger models is plausible. It suggests that smaller models can enhance the overall system's performance when combined with larger ones, rather than requiring multiple larger models to achieve strong performance. This interplay indicates a nuanced architecture where complementary strengths within CoRAG drive better results, particularly across diverse retriever qualities.
