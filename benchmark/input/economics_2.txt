Abstract

This  study  explores  the  impact  of  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  and  artificial intelligence on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in 20 OECD economies. Unlike previous research that relied on conventional panel techniques, we utilize the Method of Moment Quantile  Regression  panel  data  estimation  techniques.  This  approach  provides  quantilespecific insights while addressing issues of endogeneity and heteroscedasticity, resulting in a more nuanced and robust understanding of complex relationships. A novel aspect of this research  work  is  introducing  the  moderating  effect  of  artificial  intelligence  on  the relationship between nuclear energy and CO 2 emissions. The results found that the direct impact of artificial intelligence on CO 2 emissions is significant, while the effect of nuclear energy  technology  budgeting  is  not.  Additionally,  artificial  intelligence  moderates  the relationship  between  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  and  CO 2 emissions,  aiding nuclear energy in reducing carbon emissions across OECD countries. Our findings indicate that transitioning to a low-carbon future is achievable by replacing fossil fuel energy sources

with increased integration of artificial intelligence to promote nuclear energy technologies. This study demonstrates that energy innovations can serve as effective climate-resilience strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

1. Introduction

In the last 3 decades, rapid global climate change necessitates a global transition to environmentally  sustainable  energy  sources,  thereby  contributing  to  reducing  carbon emissions. Utilizing renewable energy sources has the potential to decrease global carbon emissions.  Several  long-term  policy  instruments  are  crucial  for  promoting  synergy  with renewable energy sources to attain sustained long-term growth (Obekpa and Alola, 2023; Yue et al., 2022). There is a growing agreement that cleaner economic productivity may be achieved through energy efficiency and the effective use of energy forms; this propels the global  ambition  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  Over  the  next  five  years,  the International Energy Agency (2021) forecasts significant growth in nuclear energy usage, notwithstanding  ongoing  discussions  about  its  designation  as  a  green  investment (International Energy Agency, 2021). Addressing climate change is inherently connected to advancing cost-effective, low-carbon energy technologies that can be implemented globally. Implementing a technology involves and interacts with numerous mechanisms, including economies of scale, research and development, and organizational learning, all of which can contribute to reducing technology costs. Reduced costs create new deployment opportunities,

resulting in a beneficial feedback loop or multiplier effect (Jessika Trancik et al., 2015). Nuclear energy is a prime example of this process among low-carbon electricity technologies.

Scholars and policy analysts have taken an interest in nuclear energy, considering these  developments.  There  is  an  opportunity  for  global  energy  systems  to  reduce  their environmental  impact  by  using  low-carbon  energy  sources  and  technology.  Despite environmentalists' longstanding opposition, some have suggested reviewing nuclear energy as a clean option to fight global warming (Hassan et al., 2023, 2022). Many clean energy sources  can  now  be  used  due  to  technological  advances  and  lower  costs,  despite transportation  costs,  growing  commodity  prices,  and  supply  chain  issues.  Despite  their popularity, renewable energy sources are being promoted to alleviate the climate catastrophe and boost economic growth. To accelerate energy innovation for decarbonization, public investment in research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) (Meckling et al., 2022; Simionescu,  2023).  The  budget  allocation  for  research  and  development  (R&D) in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and nuclear energy is critical for achieving sustainable development goals 7, 9, and 13. This will accelerate progress in energy innovation, support the shift to cleaner energy sources, and assist in mitigating climate change (Jin et al., 2023a). Sustainable development cannot be achieved without addressing the energy sector, which must simultaneously reduce harmful emissions while increasing access to energy for more individuals.  There are risks associated with every technology that might affect people and the planet. Although low-carbon energy sources do not emit carbon dioxide when they are in  use,  they  do  produce  emissions  and  trash  throughout  their  lifecycle,  from  building  to production  to  decommissioning.  Therefore,  it  is  critical  to  compare  potential  energy technologies  to  determine  how  well  they  mesh  with  sustainable  development  objectives

(World Nuclear Association, 2014). The potential impact of energy sector R&D is becoming more  recognized  considering  rising  worries  about  climate  change  and  global  warming. Government  support  for  energy  sector  R&D  is  critical  for  the  discovery  of  low-carbon technology that can maintain a steady supply of energy, lessen reliance on fossil fuels, and mitigate the financial burden of growing nonrenewable energy prices (Danish and Ulucak, 2022).

Artificial  intelligence  (AI)  is  a  pivotal  force  driving  industrial  and  technical innovation,  significantly  impacting  advancements  in  energy  conservation  and  reducing carbon emissions. Enhanced comprehension of the impact of AI on energy transition and carbon emissions may facilitate its application in achieving carbon neutrality (Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Energy production is only one of several industries that brought about a new digital age thanks to technological advancements. Rapid utilization of nuclear energy is essential to meet the decarbonization targets set for 2050. When licensing nuclear technology for commercialization, digital replicas make nuclear reactor commissioning and full-cycle operation easier. Finding ways to use fewer computing resources is necessary to industrialize  nuclear  energy  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (GHGE).  New  digital technologies are opening up exciting possibilities for practically bringing theory and practice together. Innovative technology has reached the industrial level rapidly due to the energy transition. Various technologies, including AI, are part of the nuclear sector. A regulatory framework for the age of digitization can only be established by first identifying the relevant variables. New nuclear technology capabilities will be able to flourish in the future thanks to this framework (Renteria del Toro et al., 2024).

Climate change adaptation and mitigation remain critical to achieving sustainable development while reducing climate vulnerability, particularly among climate-exposed and sensitive  regions.  Yet,  achieving  a  balance  between  climate-resilience  pathways,  high economic productivity, high human development, and energy efficiency appears complex, leading to potential trade-offs (Sarkodie et al., 2023). Against the backdrop and driven by the new possibilities for cleaner manufacturing with AI, this study focuses on how AI and nuclear  energy  technologies  influence  environmental  performance.  Strict  environmental restrictions  and  sustainable  nuclear  energy  generation  could  be  crucial  in  achieving sustainable development, which aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social well-being while ensuring a sustainable future.  This study seeks to address several questions based on the discussion. Firstly, does integrating artificial intelligence with nuclear energy technology contribute to reducing carbon emissions? Secondly, can incorporating artificial intelligence into the nuclear energy technology sector assist in managing carbon emissions? In this paper, we expand the nuclear energy and pollution model by introducing nuclear energy technology and artificial intelligence to evaluate the moderating role of AI in the relationship between NETB and CO 2 emissions.

This  study  contributes  significantly  to  the  existing  literature.  (i)  This  piece  of research work examines the impact of AI and nuclear energy technology on pollution levels in selected OECD countries. This research uses a panel data methodology to elucidate the pollution levels in OECD countries that consume nuclear energy from 1994 to 2020. (ii) The study introduces the interaction effect between AI and nuclear energy technology budgeting to  examine AI's  moderating  role  in  the  relationship  between  nuclear  energy  technology budgeting  and  CO 2 emissions.  The  moderating  role  is  essential  for  optimizing  the

deployment and utilization of nuclear energy, as AI-driven strategies can enhance the lowcarbon  advantages  of  nuclear  energy.  (iii)  This  study  employs  the  Method  of  Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) for empirical estimation. MM-QR utilizes the method of moments to develop more robust estimators compared to traditional quantile  regression, facilitating enhanced inference in complex, non-linear data structures where ordinary least squares  (OLS)  methods  may  be  inadequate.  MM-QR  contributes  methodologically  by offering  quantile-specific  insights  while  addressing  endogeneity  and  heteroscedasticity, thereby enhancing the understanding of relationships within complex data structures. This tool is essential in empirical research, especially in disciplines where it is crucial to capture distributional heterogeneity and address complex data challenges.

The article organizes the remainder of the section: Section 2 provides information about  the  profile  of  sample  countries. Afterward,  use the  econometric  tools  and  data  in Section 3, then explain and evaluate the empirical findings in Section 3.  In the last section, the paper presents its findings.

2. The Profile of Sampled OECD Countries

From 1990 to around 2010, coal and other fossil fuels played a significant role in the continuous emissions rise. However, global CO 2 emissions have stabilized over the past decade  due  to  improved  energy  efficiency  and  the  increasing  use  of  renewable  energy sources. This trend is especially evident in the United States and the European Union. The COVID-19  epidemic  caused  a  short-lived  decrease  in  emissions  in  2020,  but  when economies resumed in 2021, they quickly recovered, highlighting the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels in numerous regions worldwide (Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, 2020). In 2022,  OECD  nations  substantially  contributed  to  global  CO₂  emissions,  mainly  from energy-related sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Global emissions from the energy sector have continued to rise, particularly due to coal-fired electricity generation. Despite certain  regions  achieving  progress  in  emissions  reductions  via  the  implementation  of renewable energy, global emissions have nonetheless surged to an unprecedented level, exceeding 36.8 billion metric tons. Countries within the OECD, especially in Europe and North America, experienced diverse trends. Conversely, the United States experienced a modest rise in emissions attributed to increased demand in the building sector during severe weather events, despite the growth of clean energy sources such as wind and solar (IEA, 2022). Figure 1 shows annual per capita CO 2 emissions worldwide in 2024.

The utilization of nuclear energy has shown a consistent upward trend since the early 1960s. With a 300-gigawatt electrical (GWe) capacity, nuclear energy currently contributes 25% to the OECD countries' electricity consumption. It is crucial for maintaining the energy security of the OECD. Nuclear energy constitutes the most significant proportion of clean energy production among OECD countries. The Paris Agreement of 2015, according to the OECD database, seeks to restrict global warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels; projections indicate a rise of 3-6 degrees Celsius in the global average temperature by the century's end. Nuclear power plants, expected to supply low-carbon electricity to many countries for the forthcoming decades, will experience significant disruptions in their operations  (Nuclear  Energy  Agency,  2022).  As  significant  economies  and  notable greenhouse gas emitters, the OECD countries bear a considerable responsibility by investing significantly in energy innovation via research and development (R&D). This study seeks to investigate and propose effective policy measures concerning the role of R&D in the nuclear energy sector to mitigate pollution.

Applications aimed at boosting workplace productivity, particularly in the finance and manufacturing sectors, drove notable growth in the adoption of AI in OECD countries in 2022. A significant number of companies have implemented AI technologies for various functions,  including  production  tracking,  image  recognition,  and  natural  language processing; however, the extent of adoption has shown considerable variation. Large firms typically spearhead AI integration, particularly for tasks aimed at optimizing operations and enhancing output quality. Nonetheless, the general adoption rate stayed comparatively low, influenced  in  part  by  the  expenses  linked  to  AI  implementation  and  the  insufficient availability of skilled personnel required for its effective operation (Stijn, 2023). The trend

for the number of artificial intelligence-related patents in OECD countries comparing the data of 1995 and 2020 is shown in Figure 2.

3. Theoretical background and literature review

3.1. Theoretical background

Following  Fatouros  and  Stengos,  (2023),  this  study  within  the  framework  of  an endogenous growth model with environmental constraints and vertical innovations derives optimal  nuclear  energy  technology.  Innovation  in  this  study  is  directed  to  nuclear technologies and artificial intelligence.

Several fundamental theoretical frameworks inform policy, technological advancement,  and  strategic  planning  for  achieving  net-zero  carbon  emissions.  These frameworks  primarily  focus  on  integrating  nuclear  energy  technology  and  artificial intelligence (AI). The theory of technological innovation underpins this study, emphasizing the  role  of  technological  advancements  in  facilitating  societal  progress  and  addressing significant issues such as carbon emissions.  Key concepts like the diffusion of innovation illustrate the impact of technologies like nuclear energy and AI on various industries and society.  Innovations in nuclear energy technology-such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactor designs-present opportunities for improved safety and cost efficiency in the context of achieving net-zero emissions. Meanwhile, AI enhances the optimization of

reactor  operations,  predictive  maintenance,  and  safety  monitoring.  The  combination  of advancements in nuclear technology and AI-driven management significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of nuclear energy as a low-emission power source.

Energy  transition  models  analyze  historical  trends,  transformation  obstacles,  and elements promoting the transition to sustainable energy. Nuclear energy provides consistent baseline power, which can support the intermittent nature of renewable sources. Additionally, AI  enhances  energy  management  and  grid  reliability,  facilitating  a  smoother  transition. Policies must promote their adoption, ensure safe operation, and facilitate integration with other  low-carbon  technologies  by  enabling  nuclear  energy  and AI  to  substantially  aid  in achieving net-zero objectives. Environmental economics shapes the design of incentives and penalties,  ensuring  the  economic  viability  and  competitiveness  of  nuclear  and AI-driven systems within the energy market.

3.2. Literature Review

This  outline  presents  a  well-organized  framework  for  examining  the  effects  of nuclear energy and AI on emissions reduction, emphasizing diverse viewpoints found in the existing  literature.  Nuclear  energy  is  a  reliable  low-carbon  power  source  for  mitigating global  CO 2 emissions.  Previous  studies  examined  the  relationship  between  sufficient investment in nuclear energy infrastructure, research, and development and decreased CO 2 emissions.  The  literature  on  nuclear  energy  technology  and  CO₂  emissions  emphasizes nuclear power's role as a low-carbon energy source that supports the transition to sustainable energy systems. Studies underscore the importance of energy technology innovation and effective policy in achieving emissions reductions and advancing nuclear energy. Jordaan et

al., (2017a) highlighted Canada's uneven investment between fossil fuels and clean energy technologies, urging better alignment of federal and regional policies and enhanced financial access for clean energy projects to drive innovation and emissions reductions. This reflects a broader trend across the OECD and other developed nations, where policy plays a critical role in promoting or hindering clean energy investment (Alvarez-herranz et al., 2017; Danish and Ulucak, 2021).

Various studies showed that advancements in energy technologies, such as nuclear, play  a  crucial  role  in  decreasing  pollution.  For  instance,  Álvarez-herránz  et  al.,  (2017) discovered  that  prompt  innovation  in  the  energy  sector  improves  environmental  quality. Shahbaz et al., (2018) supported this finding in France, while, and Danish and Ulucak, (2021) emphasized  the  importance  of  energy  R&D  in  China.  Bashir  et  al.,  (2024)  arrived  at comparable conclusions for advanced industrial economies, reinforcing the argument that energy  innovation,  when  supported  by  sufficient  funding  and  policy  measures,  has  the potential to reduce emissions. Recent studies concentrate on the budgets allocated for nuclear energy research and development (R&D) and their impact on emissions.   Uche et al., (2023) observed  that  government-funded  R&D  for  nuclear  and  other  clean  energy  technologies offered  crucial  insights  for  effective  policymaking.  (Huang  et  al.,  2024a)  found  that enhanced nuclear energy budgets positively contribute to environmental quality; however, they recommend customizing policies to meet the specific requirements of each economy. Jin et al., (2023) noted that, although nuclear R&D in Germany has a restricted influence on emissions,  it  does  mitigate  ecological  degradation,  highlighting  the  complex  effects  of nuclear energy policies in different nations. Huang et al., (2024b) employed a quantile-based methodology to evaluate the asymmetric effects of nuclear energy budgets on CO2 emissions

across major economies. The findings indicated that focused investments in nuclear energy led  to  a  reduction  in  emissions  across  particular  budget  quantiles,  highlighting  the importance of optimal budget allocations for enhancing the climate advantages of nuclear energy. Shen et al., (2024) noted favorable connections between nuclear technology and emission  reduction  in  Europe  while  emphasizing  the  varied  national  patterns  in  these relationships.  In  a  related  area, Yıldırım  et  al.,  (2022)  explored  the  nonlinear  effects  of environmental innovation on emissions in OECD countries, revealing that innovation leads to  a  reduction  in  emissions  up  to  a  specific  threshold,  beyond  which  "rebound  effects" manifest. This finding highlights the critical need for stringent environmental policies to sustain the beneficial effects of innovation, a principle that also extends to nuclear energy. In  the  absence  of  sufficient  policy  backing,  the  potential  environmental  advantages  of nuclear and other low-carbon technologies might remain unfulfilled (Wang and Zhu, 2020). In summary, the existing literature consistently highlights the potential of nuclear energy to reduce CO 2 emissions, particularly when bolstered by focused policy, sufficient investment in research and development, and harmonious integration with renewable energy sources.

4. Material and Methods:

4.1. Empirical Model Specification

The study's objective is to empirically investigate the nuclear energy, AI, and CO 2 emissions nexus. For cross-sectional or panel data analysis (e.g., across OECD countries over multiple years), the model can be specified as follows:

(1)

In the above equation (1). 1 and 2 capture the effects of nuclear energy and AI on emissions. Nuclear Energy 1 negative correlation with CO₂ emissions, as nuclear power generally reduces reliance on fossil fuels. AI Efficiency Impact 2 Expected to be negative, as  AI  improvements  in  energy  management  reduce  waste  and  optimize  renewable  and nuclear use, lowering emissions. i and t represent the country and period, respectively

Nuclear energy plants can be made more efficient, more secure, and operationally effective with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), which can moderate the relationship between nuclear energy and CO₂ emissions. Since AI-driven techniques can help maximize the  low-carbon  benefits  of  nuclear  energy,  this  moderating  role  is  especially  critical  in maximizing the deployment and utilization of nuclear energy as its facilities can become even  more  effective  in  reducing  emissions  if  AI can  enhance  their  performance  and efficiency.  The  optimal  operation  of  nuclear  power  plants  is  made  possible  by  artificial intelligence  (AI)  in  predictive  maintenance,  defect  detection,  and  real-time  performance monitoring.  This  results  in  reduced  downtime  and  longer  plant  life.  Nuclear  power  can

reduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels more reliably due to its constant and efficient functioning (IAEA, 2023).

To improve the energy mix's carbon efficiency and decrease the demand for fossil fuel backup energy, AI algorithms can dynamically modulate nuclear production in reaction to changes in renewable generation (IEA, 2022). Emissions reductions are proportional to the degree to which AI enhances the integration of renewables and nuclear energy.

A  regression  model's  interaction  term  allows  one  to  examine  AI's  moderating function. For example, we can construct an empirical model in the following manner:

(2)

In  this  model,  the  interaction  term  ( LnAI it xLnNRDD it )  would  help  capture  the moderating effect of AI on the relationship between nuclear energy and CO₂ emissions. A negative and statistically significant coefficient for this term would suggest that AI enhances the emissions reduction impact of nuclear energy.

4.2. Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) method

For empirical estimation, this study used the Method of Moment Quantile MM-QR method  proposed  by  Sim  and  Zhou,  (2015).  Statistics  traditionally  use  the  MM-QR estimation technique to find estimates for model parameters by equating sample moments, such as sample means or variances, to their theoretical counterparts. In quantile regression, the MM-QR estimates the quantiles of the response variable based on the predictors. This gives a more complete picture of how the variables are connected than mean regression. The MoM approach  allows  one  to  obtain  quantile  estimates  without  needing  to  make  strict

assumptions  about  the  underlying  distribution  of  residuals,  making  it  suitable  for heteroscedastic or non-normally distributed data.

This method provides a comprehensive perspective on the influence of predictors on the  distribution  of  a  response  variable,  extending  beyond  the  mean. This  is  important  in situations where the mean does not sufficiently reflect the data's distribution or when outliers have  a  substantial  impact  on  mean-based  estimates.  This  method  enhances  robustness against outliers and model misspecification, rendering it especially beneficial in domains such  as  finance  and  economics,  where  these  challenges  commonly  occur.  This  method exhibits reduced sensitivity to outliers compared to traditional mean-based regression, as it emphasizes quantiles rather than the entire distribution. The MM-QR method addresses nonnormal distributions, effectively accommodating diverse error structures in the data, such as skewed  or  heavy-tailed  distributions.  MM-QR  offers  a  comprehensive  view  of  the conditional distribution of the response variable, which is essential for analyzing variability and  skewness  in  data.  MM-QR  estimates  parameters  by  addressing  moment  conditions, generally employing optimization methods. In this process, the error between the sample moments and theoretical moments is minimized. After estimating, interpret the regression coefficients  as  effects  on  the  specified  quantile  of  the  response  variable.  These interpretations can provide insights that differ across quantiles and reveal trends not visible in mean regression. For quantile τ, the MMQR equation can be represented as follows:

𝑄 ! (𝐶𝑂 " 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑋/ = 𝑋 # 𝛽(𝜏) +  𝜖(𝜏) (3)

Where Q τ (.) : The conditional quantile function of CO₂ emissions at quantile τ. X is a Vector of independent variables, which includes nuclear energy budgeting, AI investment, and interaction variable (AI*NRDD). b τ  Vector of coefficients specific to quantile τ that reflect the impact of each independent variable on CO₂ emissions, and ϵ(τ) is the error term associated with quantile τ.

The equation can be expanded to explicitly include NRDD and AI, as follows:

𝑄 ! (𝐶𝑂 " 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷,𝐴𝐼,(𝐴𝐼 ∗ 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷)/ = 𝛽 $ (𝜏) + 𝑋 # 𝛽 % (𝜏). 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷 + 𝑋 # 𝛽 " (𝜏). 𝐴𝐼 + 𝑋 # 𝛽 & (𝜏) 𝐴𝐼 ∗ 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷 +  𝜖(𝜏) (4)

Where,  NRDD  Nuclear  energy  budgeting  (investment  or  budget  allocation  for nuclear  technology), AI  number  of  registered AI-related  patents,  potentially  supporting optimization  and  efficiency  in  nuclear  energy.  AI*NRDD  is  the  interaction  between Artificial intelligence and nuclear energy budgeting that may influence CO₂ emissions. The MM-QR  models  are  especially  valuable  in  environmental  and  energy  economics  for capturing heterogeneous impacts across different levels of emissions, allowing for a more nuanced policy and investment approach. Finally, perform diagnostic checks to validate the model. This  may  include  testing  the  robustness  of  the  moment  conditions,  checking  for model  misspecification,  and  comparing  the  quantile  regression  estimates  with  other estimation methods.

4.3. Data

This paper covers the annual dataset for selected 20 OECD countries (refer to Table 1) from 1994 to 2020. The dependent variable is per capita CO 2 emissions (million tons of CO 2 ). Data about CO 2 emission is derived from the British Petroleum Statistical Review (BP, 2021). AI and Nuclear energy technology research and development budgets (NRDD) are used as independent variables to explain CO 2 emissions. The NRDD is measured for nuclear energy technology budgeting and measured (in a million USD and PPP). The NRDD variable can provide important information for SDG 7. AI is measured as the number of registered AI-related patents. Data on NRDD arrives from the International Energy Agency. AI data is taken from OECD databases. The trend in artificial intelligence, nuclear energy RD&D, and CO 2 emissions in sample OECD countries is shown in Figure 3.

5. Results

The first step in panel data analysis is to examine cross-sectional dependence (CD). Refraining from ignoring cross-sectional reliance can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it is advisable to use techniques such as fixed effects with crosssectional averages, factor models, or spatial econometric models to address this dependency issue effectively. This study employs the CD test for this purpose by Pesaran, (2015). The results in Table 2 reject the null hypothesis, indicating that CD exists. Due to this dependence, shared shocks can influence parameter estimates, potentially resulting in biased outcomes in models  that  assume  unit  independence.  In  international  economics,  cross-sectional dependence often suggests that global factors-such as commodity prices, financial crises, or technological spillovers-impact multiple countries simultaneously. This understanding informs the selection of appropriate models and policy recommendations.

======= INSERT TABLE 2 HERE ========

Once it is proven that the dataset is cross-sectionally dependent, the next step is to use panel unit root tests. These give essential information about the data's structure and help analysts choose the best modeling methods for accurate results. For this purpose, we utilize the CIPS and CADF unit root tests by Pesaran, (2007). The findings in Table 3 indicate a noteworthy test statistic (typically at a 5% significance level), enabling the rejection of the null hypothesis, which suggests that the series is stationary at its first difference. A nonsignificant statistic indicates that the series is non-stationary.

======= INSERT TABLE 3 HERE ========

Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) positively correlates with CO₂ emissions across all quantiles (see Table 4). Generally, an increase in AI adoption leads to an increase in CO 2 emissions, irrespective of the examined emission level (low, medium, or high quantiles). This  finding  suggests  that,  although AI  can  improve  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions  in certain contexts, its deployment might also lead to environmental costs that could outweigh these benefits. A positive coefficient at lower quantiles suggests that, even in nations with relatively  low  emissions,  including  Denmark,  Switzerland,  Norway,  Finland,  Sweden, Portugal, Hungary, and Austria, an increase in AI adoption is associated with higher CO 2 emissions. This could arise from the essential infrastructure and energy needs required for implementing AI technologies in settings that typically show reduced emissions. For average emitters (Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Australia, and Türkiye), a positive coefficient at the median level (e.g., 50th percentile) suggests a link between AI adoption and  increased  emissions. This  indicates  that  the  efficiencies  gained  through AI  may  not adequately offset the emissions generated by data processing, storage, and computational requirements. At  upper  quantiles  (e.g.,  75th  or  90th  percentile),  a  positive  coefficient indicates  that  even  significant  emitters  (Canada,  Germany,  Japan,  and  the  USA)  see  an increase in CO₂ emissions with the rise of AI adoption. Industries with significant emissions, including energy, manufacturing, and logistics, could experience a heightened environmental  impact  from  AI  due  to  the  substantial  computing  power  and  energy consumption required for extensive AI operations.

An insignificant correlation between funding for nuclear energy technology and CO 2 emissions across quantiles suggests that variations in funding for nuclear energy technology do not significantly impact CO emissions at different levels of the emissions distribution (see Table 4). This finding may arise from multiple factors about nuclear energy investments and  the  broader  energy  production  and  emissions  context. An  insignificant  relationship across quantiles in quantile regression means this lack of effect is the same for all emissions levels,  from  lower  to  higher  quantiles.  This  consistency  indicates  that  irrespective  of  a country's status as a low or high CO₂ emitter, increases in nuclear energy funding are not presently associated with emissions reductions, reinforcing the notion that nuclear budgeting may exert limited or delayed direct effects on CO₂ emissions across various emission levels.

There is a negative coefficient for AI's moderating role in the relationship between funding for nuclear energy technology and CO 2 emissions across all quantiles. This suggests that AI may help lower the CO 2 emissions from nuclear energy projects (see Table 4). AI is a mitigating factor, diminishing the positive relationship between nuclear energy investment and emissions across all levels. The application of AI in nuclear energy development and operations indicates that its efficiencies and optimizations could lead to decreased emissions throughout the project lifecycle. At lower emission levels (10th or 25th percentile), AI may have a negative moderating effect. This means that in places with moderate emissions, AI may  reduce  the  initial  CO2  footprint  of  nuclear  energy  projects.  Figuring  out  this  may necessitate the optimization of construction and logistical procedures, reducing waste, and improvement of resource efficiency. The median quantile, or 50th percentile, for average emitters, shows that AI has a moderating effect that greatly reduces emissions related to nuclear energy projects. This is achieved through AI-driven efficiency, such as predictive

maintenance, better energy management, and automation routine tasks. There is a negative coefficient for the moderating effect of AI at high quantiles, like the 75th or 90th percentile. This means that adding AI may have a big effect on situations with high emission levels. Artificial  intelligence  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  associated  with extensive nuclear initiatives, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize the integration of nuclear facilities into the energy grid.

In  quantile  regression  analysis,  plotting  the  regression  results  across  different quantiles  provides  a  robust  check  of  how  the  relationship  between  the  independent  and dependent variables changes as the outcome variable's distribution changes. Through the graphic  representation  of  these  results,  we  can  understand  the  stability  and  variation  of coefficients,  which  helps  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  findings.  In  summary,  quantile regression plots serve as an important tool for assessing robustness by demonstrating the variability  (or  consistency)  of  coefficient  estimates  across  different  quantiles.  Consistent coefficients indicate reliability, whereas fluctuations provide understanding of distributional diversity.  This  visual  representation  bolsters  confidence  in  the  results,  especially  when dealing  with  intricate  data  that  may  include  outliers,  non-normal  distributions,  or endogeneity concerns. By validating the relationship across quantiles, quantile regression plots act as a significant instrument for evaluating the robustness and depth of empirical findings.

Quantile regression plots (see Figure 4) exhibit robustness to outliers and non-normal data  distributions.  If  the  plot  indicates  that  the  coefficients  keep  their  significance  and direction across quantiles, this resilience to outliers further corroborates the stability and

validity of the relationship. It provides confidence that the results are not unduly influenced by extreme values or deviations from normality.

This approach has been used to estimate Eqs 3 & 4 to check the robustness of the quantitative  regression  analysis  results  obtained  by  the  MM-QR  method.  (1)  and  (2). Moreover,  we  conduct  a  robustness  check  by  applying  the  alternative  method  of  the augmented Anderson-Hsiao estimator AAH estimator by (Chudik and Pesaran, 2022) and the Panel -Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) method by (Beck et al., 1995) for comparison purposes. To this end, we include ln (CO 2 )it- 1 in Eqs. (1) and (2) to estimate the parameters. Here, we should indicate that as the cross-sectional dependence exists in our dataset, using conventional  panel  data  estimators  like  fixed  effect,  random  effect,  or  pooled  OLS  to estimate the static panel data models can lead to biased and inconsistent results. For this reason, we used the AAH regression method which not only considers the cross-sectional dependence but also solves autocorrelation and reduces the endogeneity issue.   The robust analysis  findings  are  reported  in  Table  5  and  confirm  our  results  about  the  sign  of  the coefficient of NRDD, AI, and the interaction effect of AI and NRDD.

4. Discussion

AI directly  impacts  CO 2 emissions  positively.  First,  the  possible  reasons  are  that training and deploying AI models, especially large ones, require significant computational resources and, therefore, energy. Data centers, cloud computing, and the hardware powering AI algorithms contribute to CO₂ emissions, often more than the efficiencies gained. Second, the infrastructure supporting AI-data centers, sensors, high-performance computers, etc.demands substantial energy. This infrastructure may lead to a direct increase in emissions, especially if powered by fossil-fuel-based energy sources. Third, AI-enabled innovations can lead  to  higher  productivity,  which  might  drive  up  consumption  and  production.  This 'rebound  effect'  can  result  in  higher  energy  demand  and  emissions,  offsetting  the efficiencies brought by AI. This positive association across all quantiles signals a potential trade-off: while AI offers benefits, its environmental costs need careful management to avoid inadvertently  worsening  CO₂  emissions  on  a  large  scale.  Overall,  an  insignificant relationship across quantiles highlights the complex and potentially indirect role of nuclear energy budgeting in emissions reduction. This finding suggests that while nuclear energy funding is crucial for long-term energy strategy, immediate and observable impacts on CO₂ emissions  may  require  additional  complementary  investments  and  policy  measures  to amplify the potential emissions reduction benefits of nuclear energy.

In many countries, nuclear energy is part of a diverse energy mix, and the impact of nuclear budgeting on CO₂ emissions may be diluted by the presence of other energy sources, especially  if  fossil  fuels  still  constitute  a  large  share  of  the  energy  supply. As  a  result, increases in nuclear funding may not have a strong, immediate, or quantifiable effect on emissions, especially if nuclear power generation remains a smaller portion of the overall

energy  grid.  Nuclear  energy  indirectly  reduces  CO₂  emissions  by  offsetting  reliance  on carbon-intensive fossil fuels. However, if nuclear investments are primarily allocated toward safety improvements, decommissioning, or research and development rather than increasing capacity, the immediate effect on CO₂ emissions could be minimal or difficult to detect. The quantile  regression  showing  insignificant  results  across  quantiles  could  suggest  that  any potential impact of nuclear budgeting on emissions may only become significant above a certain threshold of funding or nuclear capacity, which the current budget levels have not yet  reached.  This  threshold  effect  could  mean  that  without  reaching  substantial  nuclear capacity  expansion,  the  impact  on  emissions  remains  marginal.  The  creative  design  of advanced nuclear energy systems, thorough research and development, and widespread use of  next-generation  advanced  nuclear  energy  technology  will  increase  the  economy's competitiveness and enhance the safety of the nuclear energy system (Zhan et al., 2021).

AI can aid in the planning, scheduling, and managing of nuclear plant construction, optimize resource utilization, and mitigate delays. AI can enhance supply chain efficiency and  minimize  transportation  requirements,  reducing  the  indirect  CO 2 emissions  of construction  activities. After  nuclear  plants  become  operational, AI  can  improve  energy efficiency by precisely aligning energy production with demand, thereby minimizing excess energy production and related emissions. AI algorithms can forecast and mitigate equipment problems  before  failures,  decreasing  the  necessity  for  energy-intensive  repairs  and minimizing potential downtime. This may also prolong the lifespan of equipment, thereby reducing the frequency of replacements and the related manufacturing emissions. Artificial intelligence can facilitate the integration of nuclear energy into the energy grid by balancing supply  and  demand,  optimizing  energy  storage,  and  minimizing  waste.  This  mitigates

emissions from backup fossil-fuel power sources that may be required for grid stabilization. Artificial intelligence can enhance waste management processes and resource utilization, thereby  minimizing  material  waste  and  emissions  associated  with  waste  disposal  or recycling. In sum, this negative moderating effect highlights AI's potential to make nuclear energy  development  more  sustainable.  By  reducing  emissions  associated  with  nuclear projects  across  all  quantiles,  AI  could  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  cleaner  energy solutions and enhancing the environmental sustainability of nuclear power across various levels of existing emissions.

5. Conclusion

The issue of global warming is likely to persist, even beyond the established deadline for reaching carbon neutrality and the 1.5°C temperature increase threshold. Despite their knowledge of major greenhouse gases, scientists and policymakers struggle to accurately capture CO 2 emissions dynamics about their pathways (GHGs) (Magazzino et al., 2024). In this regard, we identified gaps in the literature regarding the analysis of the interactions of AI and nuclear energy technology budgeting (composite variable) with CO 2 emissions. Thus, this study employed a robust econometric approach in evaluating the present relationships between  AI  and  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  (composite  variable)  with  CO 2 emissions.  On  the  methodological  side,  we  introduce  a  novel  approach  by  introducing moderating AI in the relationship between nuclear energy technology budgeting and CO 2 emissions. For empirical estimates, the study relies on the MM-QR method.  Here, we were able  to  demonstrate  that  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  does  influence  all  CO 2 emissions. We also observed that AI could contribute to CO 2 emissions directly. However, novel findings related to the interaction effect of AI and nuclear energy technology budget,

the  findings  reveal  that  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  reduces  carbon  emissions through AI.

Policymakers  may  need  to  introduce  incentives  for  renewable  energy  use  in AIrelated  operations  or  promote  the  development  of  more  energy-efficient AI  algorithms. Governments could conduct thorough environmental impact assessments for AI initiatives, especially in industries that are heavy emitters. Efforts to develop AI solutions specifically targeted  at  reducing  emissions  and  enhancing  energy  efficiency  should  be  prioritized  to counteract  the  possible  environmental  costs  of  AI  deployment.  Policymakers  and stakeholders  need  to  consider  the  short-term  emissions  increase  associated  with  nuclear energy  development  against  its  long-term  potential  for  low-emission  energy  production. Clear strategies  can  help  bridge  the  gap  until  the  emissions-reducing  benefits  of  nuclear power are realized. Emissions during the construction and development phases could be minimized by adopting low-carbon materials, recycling construction waste, and utilizing renewable energy for construction activities. Investing in nuclear energy might be balanced with other renewable options, like solar and wind, that have shorter development times and can begin reducing emissions sooner. This integrated strategy could help mitigate the shortterm  emissions  spike  often  linked  to  the  development  of  nuclear  energy.  A  positive coefficient  may  raise  concerns  among  stakeholders  or  the  public,  who  expect  nuclear investments to lead to lower emissions. Therefore, it is essential to communicate effectively about nuclear project lifecycle emissions, including the initial increase in emissions and the long-term benefits. This communication is vital for managing expectations.

Policymakers and stakeholders should prioritize allocating funding and resources to integrate AI in nuclear energy projects, as this approach has the potential to enhance the

environmental advantages of nuclear energy by reducing CO 2 emissions. Targeted research into AI applications for emission reduction can further improve its moderating effect. This could involve creating targeted AI algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, optimize carbon capture, and facilitate predictive maintenance designed explicitly for nuclear facilities. The partnership between the AI and nuclear energy sectors has the potential to foster innovations that  leverage  AI's  capabilities  to  reduce  emissions,  establishing  industry  standards  and frameworks  for  implementing AI  in  nuclear  initiatives.  Despite  the  long-term  nature  of nuclear  projects,  a  negative  moderating  role  of  AI  could  accelerate  the  realization  of emissions reduction benefits. Transparent reporting of these benefits may assist in managing public and stakeholder expectations, illustrating AI's role in enhancing the environmental viability of nuclear energy.

The research highlights several significant limitations: obtaining reliable, real-time data on nuclear operations and budgets, as well as the adoption of AI in the nuclear sector, is  often  hindered  by  confidentiality  and  regulatory  restrictions.  This  scarcity  of  data undermines the accuracy of AI model predictions and restricts the study's ability to reflect current technological and financial trends. Additionally, variations in data availability and accuracy across different regions pose substantial challenges in generalizing findings on a global  scale.  Furthermore,  differing  reporting  standards  among  nations  could  affect  the study's ability to consistently evaluate the impact of AI on nuclear energy investment and emissions reduction.
