The performance comparison between CoRAG and Atlas-11B on specific datasets like the FEVER dataset can provide insights into potential strengths and weaknesses of different models. Here are some considerations that could explain why one model might outperform another, even if they perform well across other tasks:

### Model Architecture and Training Data
1. **Specific Dataset Focus**: The FEVER dataset focuses heavily on fact verification, which is a specialized task compared to the more general-purpose language understanding and generation tasks where models like Atlas-11B may have been trained.
   
2. **Training Data Quality and Diversity**: If Atlas-11B was primarily fine-tuned on large-scale datasets that lack high-quality factual validation or if it had limited exposure to fact verification tasks during its training, this might explain why it underperforms on the FEVER dataset.

### Transfer Learning and Adaptation
3. **Transfer Learning Potential**: Models like CoRAG might be designed specifically for fact verification tasks, meaning they have undergone fine-tuning with relevant data or use specialized architectures that enhance their performance in such domains.
   
4. **Adaptation Strategies**: If Atlas-11B was trained on a wide range of diverse tasks and then adapted (fine-tuned) only on FEVER using techniques like transfer learning from related domains, it might not have the optimal adaptation for fact verification.

### Task-Specific Limitations
5. **Task-specific Fine-Tuning**: Fact verification requires models to identify factual statements reliably and differentiate between true and false statements. If Atlas-11B was fine-tuned on a broader range of tasks that involve language understanding but do not heavily emphasize this specific task, it may struggle in FEVER.

6. **Model Architecture Adaptation**: Models like CoRAG might have been specifically adapted to handle the nuances and complexities required for fact verification tasks, including aspects such as confidence scoring in factual statements.

### Conclusion
The discrepancy suggests that Atlas-11B, despite performing well elsewhere, may not have optimal adaptation or fine-tuning strategies for the specific challenges posed by the FEVER dataset. This could indicate that some models are more robust when they are specifically tailored to fact verification tasks. This observation supports the idea that task-specific limitations might be playing a role in this performance disparity.

In summary, it's possible that Atlas-11B does not have sufficient adaptation or fine-tuning specific to fact verification tasks on FEVER, which could suggest inherent task-specific challenges and potential areas for improvement in transfer learning strategies.
