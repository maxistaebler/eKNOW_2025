The reliance on automated rejection sampling for intermediate chain generation could potentially introduce confirmation bias, although empirical evidence from the provided data is limited. This is because automated systems might be more prone to accepting or rejecting steps based on predefined criteria rather than a comprehensive exploration of all possible alternatives [Data: Relationships (375, 404, 407); Entities (180, 221)]. In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains benefit from the diverse and nuanced decision-making processes that humans bring to the table. Humans can consider a broader range of possibilities and adjust their judgments based on context and experience [Data: Entities (9, 10, 17, 18)].

Automated rejection sampling might streamline the process by filtering out unlikely or irrelevant steps efficiently. However, this efficiency could also result in overlooking potentially valuable but unconventional reasoning paths that humans are more likely to explore [Data: Relationships (3)]. The nature of automated systems is often designed to optimize for speed and accuracy within specific constraints, which may not always align with exploring all possible reasoning chains comprehensively.

In comparison, human-annotated reasoning chains can exhibit a higher degree of adaptability and flexibility. Humans are capable of re-evaluating assumptions and considering alternative viewpoints, even if they initially seem less likely [Data: Entities (11, 13, 14)]. This adaptability can lead to more balanced and thorough reasoning processes.

In summary, while automated rejection sampling in intermediate chain generation might be efficient, it could introduce confirmation bias by limiting the exploration of diverse reasoning paths. Human-annotated chains, on the other hand, benefit from a richer and more flexible cognitive process that allows for a broader consideration of alternatives [Data: Relationships (375, 404, 407); Entities (9, 10, 17, 18)]. This comparison underscores the importance of understanding both approaches' strengths and limitations in various contexts.
