Regarding the use of automated rejection sampling for generating intermediate chain responses, there is no direct data provided that explicitly addresses whether such methods can lead to confirmation bias. However, we can make some commentary based on general understanding.

Confirmation bias refers to a tendency in humans to favor information or arguments that support their preexisting beliefs and ignore evidence that contradicts them. Automated systems, which are often programmed with algorithms designed to be objective and unbiased, generally aim to avoid this cognitive bias.

Automated rejection sampling is typically a statistical method used in machine learning for generating data samples from complex probability distributions. In the context of language models or AI systems, such methods might be employed when trying to generate diverse but coherent intermediate responses within a chain of reasoning. While these algorithms are designed to explore possible pathways and evaluate them based on certain criteria (such as coherence and relevance), they don't inherently incorporate human biases.

In contrast, human-annotated chains often involve explicit validation and correction by humans who may have their own subjective views or preconceptions that can influence the annotations. This is why human feedback can sometimes introduce bias into a system; for instance, if annotators are not careful in providing guidance or corrections, they might inadvertently promote certain patterns of reasoning over others.

To understand how automated systems like those using rejection sampling might address confirmation bias, one could look at specific applications and research studies that have explored the incorporation of diverse training data, robust evaluation metrics, and mechanisms to encourage exploration rather than preference for certain responses. These strategies might help mitigate any implicit biases in the model's output by ensuring a broader range of potential outcomes are considered.

In summary, while automated rejection sampling does not inherently introduce confirmation bias given its design principles, it is important for developers to ensure robust validation processes and diverse datasets to minimize such issues. In comparison, human-annotated reasoning chains may be more prone to incorporating subjective biases, even when guided by well-intentioned human annotators.

This discussion can be supported by the data points:
- The "sources" table provides context on user queries (id 80) and search tasks related to automated systems.
- The "in_context" column for these sources indicates that they are relevant for understanding the broader context of prompt engineering and reward structures, but not specifically confirming or contradicting claims about confirmation bias in automated rejection sampling. 

Without specific studies directly addressing this topic, we can infer from general AI principles and practices that automated methods are designed to avoid confirmation bias, while human-annotated reasoning chains may be more susceptible due to the influence of individual biases.
