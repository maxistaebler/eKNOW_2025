When considering the environmental impact of deploying large-scale AI systems like those that require 128,000 token processing capacity, several factors and considerations are taken into account. However, as a language model myself, I don't have real-time access to specific details about the environmental assessments conducted for Alibaba Cloud's operations or deployments. 

That said, it is common practice in large-scale AI deployment environments to conduct comprehensive environmental impact assessments (EIAs) that consider various aspects of energy consumption and carbon footprint. These assessments typically cover:

1. **Energy Consumption**: Assessing the energy used by servers, data centers, cooling systems, and any other hardware involved in processing large datasets.
2. **Carbon Emissions**: Estimating greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation to power the AI systems.
3. **Water Usage**: Evaluating water consumption for cooling and other purposes.
4. **Waste Production**: Assessing waste generated during the operation of data centers, including electronic waste from hardware disposal.
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Analyzing how efficiently energy is used in various components of the system to minimize wastage.

In the context of AI deployments by Alibaba Cloud, they likely adhere to industry standards and best practices for reducing their environmental impact. This might include:

- **Energy Efficiency Improvements**: Investing in more efficient servers, cooling systems, and power distribution solutions.
- **Renewable Energy Sources**: Utilizing renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power where possible.
- **Data Center Optimization**: Ensuring data centers are located efficiently to minimize transportation emissions for hardware delivery.
- **Carbon Offsetting Programs**: Participating in carbon offsetting programs that compensate for unavoidable emissions through initiatives like reforestation projects.

For specific and up-to-date information about the environmental assessments conducted by Alibaba Cloud, you would need to refer to their official sustainability reports or contact them directly.
