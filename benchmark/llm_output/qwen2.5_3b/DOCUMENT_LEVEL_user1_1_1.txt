The provided data tables do not contain any information relevant to evaluating the potential introduction of confirmation bias into intermediate chain generation through automated methods compared to human-annotated reasoning chains. The available content pertains specifically to a report titled "ByteDance Research and the PaSa Project," which does not offer insights into these comparative issues.

In discussions about data analysis and machine learning, it's common for researchers to explore various methodologies like automated rejection sampling versus manually curated datasets or reasoning steps. However, without specific data related to such comparisons from reputable sources in machine learning research, I cannot generate a detailed response addressing the specifics of confirmation bias introduced by different methods of chain generation.

For an analysis on whether automated rejection sampling introduces confirmation bias and how this compares to human-annotated chains, one would need additional information sourced from studies or reports that have examined these specific methodologies.
