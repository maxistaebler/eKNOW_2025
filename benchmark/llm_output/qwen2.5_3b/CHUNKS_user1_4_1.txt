In the context provided, there is no direct information about real-world deployment challenges or safeguards related to compute costs for large language models (LMs). The paper's focus appears to be on the theoretical aspects of performance enhancement through token consumption in LMs. However, we can infer some potential safeguards and constraints based on general knowledge from the datasets available.

Firstly, let's look at [Data: sources (15, 16)](https://example.com/sources/80,92). These sources suggest that user queries often involve considerations around reward structures in sparse execution scenarios. This implies that models are trained to understand the value and relevance of tokens within a query context.

From our understanding, real-world deployments need mechanisms to control computational costs without significantly impacting performance or limiting model capabilities. One safeguard is the use of token limits or budgets in system implementations. These bounds prevent excessive consumption of compute resources by controlling how many tokens can be processed at any one time. Another common measure involves employing sparse execution strategies where only critical or relevant parts of a large text prompt are executed, thus reducing overall computational demands.

The [Data: sources (3)] also mentions the concept of "flaming-hot" execution, which implies efficient handling of frequent and recurring tasks. Efficient implementation in real-world settings might include caching results for frequently used tokens to avoid redundant computations, enhancing both performance and resource efficiency.

While these measures are theoretical considerations from sparse reward scenarios, they can be applied more broadly to ensure that LMs remain cost-effective and scalable even under diverse deployment conditions. Real-world data may indicate further optimizations or constraints specific to particular environments and use cases.

In summary, safeguards against exponential compute costs could include token budgets, sparse execution strategies, caching of results, and possibly other mechanisms yet to be identified in the real-world datasets provided. The core challenge revolves around balancing computational efficiency with model performance optimization across various deployment scenarios.
