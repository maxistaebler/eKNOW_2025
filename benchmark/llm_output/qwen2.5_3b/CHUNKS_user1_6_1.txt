The provided dataset does not contain sufficient information to conclusively determine why iterative rejection sampling improves performance on 2WikiMultihopQA and potentially degrades it when applied to other datasets. The data tables do not include the necessary details about the performance metrics, evaluation methods, or specific improvements associated with iterative rejection sampling across different datasets.

However, I can offer some general insights:

- **Iterative Rejection Sampling**: This technique is often used in reinforcement learning and generative models for sample generation by iteratively rejecting samples that are deemed unsuitable until a suitable one is found. It works well when the likelihood of generating high-quality samples is higher compared to other sampling methods.

- **2WikiMultihopQA**: If this task has inherent challenges or characteristics (e.g., complex reasoning, diverse information sources) where iterative rejection sampling can be more effective in finding satisfactory solutions through multiple attempts, it could lead to better performance. The dataset might require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability to provide meaningful answers.

- **Other Datasets**: On the other hand, if these datasets have different characteristics (e.g., simpler questions, higher consistency across samples) where iterative rejection sampling does not yield significant improvements or may even degrade performance by introducing unnecessary variability and complexity, it could be an indication of diminishing returns. In some cases, alternative methods that focus on generating high-quality initial samples might perform better.

- **Diminishing Returns**: The concept of "diminishing returns" in this context suggests that as we apply iterative rejection sampling more aggressively or extensively to generate training data for a model (as is often the case with reinforcement learning models), its effectiveness might start to wane. This could be due to increased computational costs, less effective use of resources, or other factors specific to each dataset.

- **Application Specificity**: The observed behavior indicates that iterative rejection sampling is not universally applicable and may need tailored approaches depending on the task at hand. It highlights the importance of empirical evaluation and potentially adaptive methods in practice.

In conclusion, while we cannot definitively conclude why iterative rejection sampling works differently for 2WikiMultihopQA compared to other datasets based solely on the provided information, it does suggest potential challenges or opportunities specific to 2WikiMultihopQA. The idea of diminishing returns hints at a need for careful consideration and possibly innovative techniques when using such methods in different contexts.

For precise answers and thorough understanding, additional data on performance metrics, model architectures, and evaluation methodologies across various datasets would be necessary.
