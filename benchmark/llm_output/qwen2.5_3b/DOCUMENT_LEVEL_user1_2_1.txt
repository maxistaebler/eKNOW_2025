The provided data tables do not contain any information relevant to explaining the inconsistent performance of models like Search-o1-32B and CoRAG across different datasets such as Bamboogle. The available dataset focuses on ByteDance Research and their PaSa Project, which does not provide insights into the behavior or performance differences seen in other benchmark tests.

Given that there is no specific data to support this question, a suitable response would be:

"No relevant information found in the provided tables to address how Search-o1-32B outperformed CoRAG on the Bamboogle dataset. [Data: +more]."

This statement acknowledges the lack of supporting evidence while also indicating that more detailed examination across various datasets and models is required for a comprehensive understanding of these performance discrepancies.
