ARTICLE I: STOCKHOLDERS

Section 1.1    Annual Meetings. If required by applicable law, an annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date and time as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ' Board '). The meeting may be held either at a place, within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communication as the Board in its sole discretion may determine. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

Section 1.2    Special Meetings. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the ' Certificate of Incorporation '), special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairperson of the Board, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships (the ' Whole Board ' ) , and may not be called by any other person or persons. Any special meeting may be held either  at  a  place,  within  or  without  the  State  of  Delaware,  or  by  means  of  remote  communication  as  the  Board  in  its  sole  discretion  may  determine.  The business to be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been called as set forth in the notice of such meeting.

Section  1.3        Notice  of  Meetings. Notice  of  all  meetings  of  stockholders  shall  be  given  in  writing  or  by  electronic  transmission  in  the  manner provided by applicable law (including, without limitation, as set forth in Section 7.1.1 of these Bylaws) stating the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  such  notice  shall  be  given  not  less  than  ten  (10),  nor  more  than  sixty  (60),  days  before  the  date  of  the  meeting  to  each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.

Section 1.4    Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place (if any) thereof and the means of remote communications (if any) by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken or are provided in any other manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the ' DGCL '); provided, however , that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting; provided , further , that if after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting (which record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting shall be the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting), and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Board may postpone, reschedule or cancel any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of stockholders.

Section  1.5        Quorum. Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  applicable  law,  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  or  these  Bylaws,  at  each  meeting  of stockholders the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote at that meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction

of business. If such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 1.4 of these Bylaws, until such quorum shall be present or represented by proxy. Shares of the Corporation's stock belonging to the Corporation (or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation are held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation or to any other entity, if a majority of the voting power of such other entity is otherwise controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation),  shall  neither  be  entitled  to  vote  nor  counted  for  quorum  purposes; provided,  however ,  that  the  foregoing  shall  not  limit  the  right  of  the Corporation or any other corporation to vote any shares of the Corporation's stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity and to count such shares for purposes of determining a quorum.

Section 1.6    Organization; Conduct of Meetings. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by such director or officer as the Board may designate or, in the absence of such a person, the Chairperson of the Board, or, in the absence of such person, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, or, in the absence of such person, the President of the Corporation, or, in the absence of such person, any director or officer as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in-person or by proxy, at the meeting. Such person shall be chairperson of the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the right and authority to convene and, for any or no reason, to recess and/or to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as in his or her judgment are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chairperson, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairperson of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the  meeting  after  the  time  fixed  for  the  commencement  thereof;  and  (v)  limitations  on  the  time  allotted  to  questions  or  comments  by  participants.  The chairperson of the meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and, if such chairperson should so determine, such chairperson shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in such person's absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Section  1.7        Voting;  Proxies. Each  stockholder  entitled  to  vote  at  a  meeting  of  stockholders,  or  to  take  corporate  action  by  consent  without  a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Such a proxy may be prepared, transmitted and delivered in any manner permitted by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or any other applicable rules or regulations, including the applicable rules or regulations of any stock exchange, every matter other than the election of directors shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for or against such matter, and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither abstentions nor broker non-votes shall be counted as votes cast for or against such matter.

Section 1.8    Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.

1.8.1    Meetings. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60), nor less than ten (10), days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes such record date for notice of such meeting, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the  time  it  fixes  such  record  date  for  notice  of  such  meeting,  that  a  later  date  on  or  before  the  date  of  the  meeting  shall  be  the  date  for  making  such determination.  If  no  record  date  is  fixed  by  the  Board,  then  the  record  date  for  determining  stockholders  entitled  to  notice  of  or  to  vote  at  a  meeting  of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any

adjournment of the meeting; provided, however , that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and, in such case, shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

 1.8.2    Stockholder Action by Consent. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 1.8.2, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law. If no record date has been fixed by the Board pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 1.8.2, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting if prior action by the Board is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 1.8.3    Other Matters. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Section  1.9        List  of  Stockholders  Entitled  to  Vote. The  Corporation  shall  prepare,  no  later  than  the  tenth  (10th)  day  before  each  meeting  of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided , however , if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section 1.9 shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of ten (10) days ending on the day before the meeting date,  (i)  on  a  reasonably  accessible  electronic  network  (provided  that  the  information  required  to  gain  access  to  the  list  is  provided  with  the  notice  of  the meeting), or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation.

Section 1.10    Action by Consent of Stockholders .

1.10.1    General. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL. If an action by consent under this Section 1.10 has been taken by stockholders by less than unanimous consent, prompt notice of the taking of the action by consent shall be given to those stockholders as of the record date for the action by consent who have not consented and who would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the action had been taken at a meeting and the record date for the notice of the meeting were the record date for the action by consent.

1.10.2    Procedures. No consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section 1.10 and applicable law within 60 days of the first date on which a consent is so delivered to the Corporation.

Section 1.11    Inspectors of Elections .

 1.11.1    Appointment. The Corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairperson of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.

 1.11.2    Inspector's Oath. Each inspector of election, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector's ability.

 1.11.3    Duties of Inspectors. At a meeting of stockholders, the inspectors of election shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting  power  of  each  share,  (b)  determine  the  shares  represented  at  a  meeting  and  the  validity  of  proxies  and  ballots,  (c)  count  all  votes  and  ballots,  (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period of time a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors.

 1.11.4    Opening and Closing of Polls. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced by the chairperson of the meeting at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto,  shall  be  accepted  by  the  inspectors  after  the  closing  of  the  polls  unless  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware  upon  application  by  a stockholder shall determine otherwise.

 1.11.5    Determinations. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in accordance with Section 211(e) or Section 212(c)(2) of the DGCL or any information provided pursuant to Section 211(a)(2)b.(i) or (iii) of the DGCL, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation, except that the inspectors may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted under the DGCL and set forth herein, the inspectors at the  time  they  make  their  certification  of  their  determinations  pursuant  to  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  DGCL  set  forth  herein  shall  specify  the  precise information considered by them, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors' belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

ARTICLE VI: INDEMNIFICATION

Section 6.1    Indemnification of Officers and Directors. Each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, legislative or any other type whatsoever (a ' Proceeding '), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while serving as a director or officer of  the  Corporation,  is  or  was  serving  at  the  request  of  the  Corporation  as  a  director,  officer,  employee,  agent  or  trustee  of  another  corporation,  or  of  a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (for purposes of this Article VI, an ' Indemnitee '), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise  taxes  and  penalties  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement)  reasonably  incurred  or  suffered  by  such  Indemnitee  in  connection  therewith,  provided  such Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with  respect  to  any  criminal  action  or  Proceeding,  had  no  reasonable  cause  to  believe  the  Indemnitee's  conduct  was  unlawful.  Such  indemnification  shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnitees' heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section 6.5, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article VI to indemnify any Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the first instance by the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall indemnify such Indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.

Section 6.2    Advance of Expenses. The Corporation shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by such an Indemnitee in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however , that the payment of such expenses incurred by such an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.

Section 6.3    Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion but subject to applicable law,  to  provide  rights  to  indemnification  or  advancement  of  expenses  to  any  person  other  than  an  Indemnified  Person  or  to  provide  greater  rights  to indemnification and advancement of expenses than those provided in this Article VI to any Indemnified Person.

Section 6.4    Indemnification Agreements. The Board is authorized to cause the Corporation to enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, trustee, partner or managing member of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing indemnification or advancement rights to such person. Such rights may be greater than those provided in this Article VI.

Section 6.5    Claims .

6.5.1    Right to Bring Suit. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such Proceeding) under Section 6.1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or a claim for advancement of expenses is not  paid  in  full  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  Corporation  has  received  a  statement  or  statements  therefor,  the  Indemnitee  shall  be  entitled  at  any  time thereafter (but not before) to bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for entitlement to indemnification under applicable law.

6.5.2    Effect of Determination. Neither the failure of the Corporation (whether by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of a suit by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct to be entitled to indemnification under applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (whether by its directors who are not parties to such action, a  committee  of  such  directors,  independent  legal  counsel  or  its  stockholders)  that  the  Indemnitee  has  not  met  such  standard  of  conduct,  shall  create  a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.

6.5.3    Burden of Proof. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking provided hereunder, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or is required to repay any amounts advanced pursuant to the terms of such undertaking, under this Article VI shall be on the Corporation.

Section 6.6    Nature of Rights. The rights conferred upon Indemnitees in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under this Article VI shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to  these  Bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the Proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought.

Section 6.7    Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, trustee, partner or managing member of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

Section 6.8    Certain Defined Terms. Any reference to an officer of the Corporation in this Article VI shall be deemed to refer exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Operating Officer, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or the Secretary appointed pursuant to Article IV of these Bylaws, and to any other officer of the Corporation appointed by (x) the Board pursuant to Article IV of these Bylaws or (y) an officer to whom the Board has delegated the power to appoint officers pursuant to Article IV of these Bylaws, and any reference to an officer of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an officer appointed by the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of such other entity pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The fact that any person who is or was an employee of the Corporation or an employee of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise has been given or has used the title of 'vice president' or any other title that could be construed to suggest or imply that such person is or may be an officer of the Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall not result in such person being constituted as, or being deemed to be, an officer of the Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for purposes of this Article VI.
