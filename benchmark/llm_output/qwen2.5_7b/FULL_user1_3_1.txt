The performance discrepancies between models like CoRAG and Atlas-11B on the FEVER dataset can be attributed to several factors, including model architecture, training data, fine-tuning strategies, and specific aspects of the tasks involved. Here are some potential reasons why CoRAG might underperform on FEVER compared to Atlas-11B:

1. **Task-Specific Adaptation**: The FEVER task involves a unique combination of natural language understanding (NLU) and reasoning processes that may require different architectural or fine-tuning strategies than those used in other tasks where CoRAG excelled. Models like Atlas-11B might have been more specifically optimized for the nuances of fact verification, which can include handling complex logical structures, dealing with misinformation, and making nuanced judgments based on limited evidence.

2. **Training Data Differences**: The datasets used to train CoRAG and Atlas-11B may differ in their coverage and quality of examples that are relevant to the FEVER task. If CoRAG was primarily trained on a broader range of tasks or datasets without extensive focus on fact verification, it might struggle more with the specific challenges posed by FEVER.

3. **Fine-Tuning Strategies**: The way these models were fine-tuned for the FEVER task could play a significant role. Different models may require different strategies to perform well in specialized domains like fact verification. Atlas-11B might have been fine-tuned using more targeted data or with specific techniques that are particularly effective for this task.

4. **Model Size and Complexity**: Larger models, like Atlas-11B, often contain more parameters and can potentially capture a wider range of linguistic and logical complexities. This might give them an edge in tasks requiring deep understanding and nuanced reasoning, such as fact verification.

5. **Evaluation Metrics and Performance Indicators**: The evaluation metrics used for FEVER (evidence-based verification) may not align perfectly with the metrics on which CoRAG excelled elsewhere. If there are nuances or specific requirements of these metrics that CoRAG is less well-suited to handle, this could contribute to its underperformance.

6. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Models often benefit from being trained on datasets that closely resemble the domain in question. FEVER involves a domain-specific challenge (identifying whether claims are supported by evidence), and models might perform better if they have been trained on data that closely mirrors these scenarios.

7. **Inference Time and Computational Resources**: Sometimes, more complex models like Atlas-11B can be more computationally intensive during inference, which could affect their performance in real-time applications or when evaluated against time constraints specific to the FEVER task.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to infer that there are indeed task-specific limitations in fact verification that certain models may struggle with. This highlights the importance of designing and fine-tuning models specifically for the tasks they will be used in, especially when those tasks involve complex reasoning or domain-specific knowledge.
