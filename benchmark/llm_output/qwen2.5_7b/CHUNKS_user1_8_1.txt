Based on the provided data, there is no specific information regarding environmental impact assessments (EIAs) conducted for the deployment of large-scale language models with 128k token capabilities. The dataset primarily focuses on technical aspects such as methodologies and researchers involved rather than environmental impacts.

However, it's important to note that the deployment of large-scale language models like HAI-LLM involves significant energy consumption due to high computational requirements. Given this context, one might reasonably infer that organizations developing or deploying such models would be required to consider and potentially conduct EIAs as part of their environmental stewardship practices. Nonetheless, specific details on these assessments are not present in the provided tables.

To provide a more comprehensive answer, it would be beneficial to consult additional sources or reports dedicated to the environmental impacts of AI and large language models. These could include academic papers, industry guidelines, or official documents from relevant organizations that address sustainability and ethical considerations in AI development and deployment.

In summary:
- Data does not explicitly mention EIAs for 128k token models.
- Large-scale deployments likely require consideration of EIA due to high energy consumption.
- Further research is recommended for detailed information on environmental impact assessments. [Data: Sources (33); Relationships (18, 19)]
