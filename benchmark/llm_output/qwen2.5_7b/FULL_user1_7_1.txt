To dynamically optimize the trade-off between reducing tokens and maintaining or improving EM (Exact Match) scores in a production system, you can employ a combination of techniques such as model tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and adaptive training strategies. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. **Model Architecture and Hyperparameters**
- **Layer-wise Learning Rates:** Implement different learning rates for different layers. This can help the model converge faster without overfitting.
- **Regularization Techniques:** Use dropout or other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, which might otherwise cause a drop in EM scores.

### 2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- **Grid Search and Random Search:** Perform grid search and random search for hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, dropout rates, etc.
- **Bayesian Optimization:** Use Bayesian optimization techniques to find the optimal set of hyperparameters more efficiently than traditional methods.

### 3. **Adaptive Training Strategies**
- **Early Stopping with Validation EM Score:** Instead of stopping early based solely on token reduction, use a validation dataset to monitor the EM score and stop training when it starts degrading.
- **Dynamic Token Budget:** Implement an adaptive mechanism where the system dynamically adjusts the token budget during the training process. For example, you can start with a higher token limit and reduce it as long as the performance (EM score) does not degrade significantly.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance on EM scores is robust across different subsets of the data.
- **Confidence Scores:** Introduce confidence scores for predictions, which can help in deciding when to stop or adjust token usage more accurately.

### 5. **Post-Processing and Inference**
- **Beam Search:** Use beam search during inference rather than greedy decoding. Beam search considers multiple candidate sequences at each step, potentially leading to higher EM scores.
- **Masked Language Modeling:** Incorporate masked language modeling techniques where parts of the text are intentionally masked out for training. This can improve the model's understanding and generation capabilities.

### 6. **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring tools to track both token usage and EM scores during production.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Use feedback mechanisms where user interactions or system diagnostics provide insights that can be used to refine the model further.

### 7. **Model Ensemble Techniques**
- **Ensemble Models:** Train multiple models with different configurations and use ensemble techniques to combine their predictions. This can help in achieving a better balance between token usage and EM scores.
- **Transfer Learning:** Leverage transfer learning from pre-trained models that have been optimized for similar tasks, which can provide a good starting point.

### 8. **Iterative Improvement**
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up a CI/CD pipeline where new versions of the model are tested and deployed iteratively based on performance metrics.
- **A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B testing to compare different configurations and decide which settings work best in production.

By employing these strategies, you can dynamically optimize the trade-off between reducing tokens and maintaining or improving EM scores in a production system. This approach will help ensure that your model performs well under various conditions while also being efficient in terms of resource utilization.
