The performance of models like CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Atlas-11B can vary significantly across different tasks, including fact verification benchmarks like FEVER. Several factors could contribute to why CoRAG underperforms on FEVER compared to Atlas-11B:

1. **Task-Specific Adaptation**: Atlas-11B might be better adapted or fine-tuned specifically for the FEVER dataset. Fine-tuning involves training a model on a specific task, which can significantly improve its performance on that task.

2. **Retrieval Quality**: CoRAG relies heavily on retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant documents from an external corpus. If the retrieval system is not optimized for the type of information required by FEVER, it could lead to suboptimal performance. Atlas-11B might have a more robust or better-integrated retrieval mechanism tailored for fact verification.

3. **Model Architecture**: The architecture of Atlas-11B might be inherently better suited for the specific challenges posed by FEVER. For example, it could have better handling of long-range dependencies, which are crucial in verifying complex claims.

4. **Data Characteristics**: The nature of the data in FEVER (which involves verifying claims against a large corpus of Wikipedia articles) might favor models that can handle dense retrieval and precise information extraction more effectively. If CoRAG's retrieval mechanism is not as efficient or accurate for this type of data, it could underperform.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: The evaluation metrics used in FEVER might also play a role. Different models might excel at different aspects of the task (e.g., precision vs. recall), and if Atlas-11B is better optimized for these specific metrics, it could show superior performance.

6. **Generalization vs. Specialization**: CoRAG's strength lies in its ability to generalize across a wide range of tasks by leveraging external knowledge. However, this generalization might come at the cost of specialized performance on tasks like FEVER, where Atlas-11B might have been specifically designed or fine-tuned.

These factors suggest that there are indeed task-specific limitations in fact verification. Different models and architectures can excel in different scenarios depending on their design, training data, and optimization for specific tasks. This highlights the importance of tailoring models to the particular requirements of a given task to achieve optimal performance.
