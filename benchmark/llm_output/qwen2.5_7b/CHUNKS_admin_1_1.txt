Automated rejection sampling for generating intermediate chain samples can potentially introduce confirmation bias, depending on the design of the algorithm and the criteria used for sampling. This is because rejection sampling involves accepting or rejecting samples based on predefined conditions, which might inadvertently favor certain outcomes over others. For instance, if the rejection criterion is biased towards specific types of responses, this could lead to a skewed distribution of generated chains.

In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains are inherently less prone to such biases due to the subjective nature of human judgment. Humans can adapt their annotations based on various factors and may be more flexible in considering diverse possibilities during the reasoning process. However, this flexibility also means that human annotation might introduce other forms of bias if not carefully controlled or standardized.

To illustrate, let's examine some relevant data points:

- **Automated Rejection Sampling**: The method relies heavily on predefined criteria for accepting or rejecting samples. This can lead to confirmation bias if the criteria are not neutral and unbiased (Data: Sources [0], Relationships [18]).
  
- **Human-annotated Reasoning Chains**: These rely on human judgment, which can introduce various forms of personal biases unless stringent guidelines are in place to ensure objectivity (Data: Entities [5, 7]).

In summary, while automated rejection sampling might suffer from confirmation bias due to its deterministic nature and predefined criteria, human-annotated reasoning chains can be equally biased but for different reasons. The key difference lies in the potential adaptability of human judgment versus the rigidity of algorithmic rules (Data: Sources [18], Relationships [5, 7]). 

Therefore, it is crucial to consider both methods critically and implement robust measures to mitigate biases in either approach. This might involve developing more sophisticated algorithms for automated sampling or establishing clear guidelines and training programs for human annotators to ensure a balanced and unbiased outcome (Data: Entities [18, 20]).
