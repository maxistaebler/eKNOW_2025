The phrase "CoRAG" is not commonly associated with any specific work in my current knowledge base, so I'll interpret your question based on typical AI frameworks and their interactions with retrieval components.

If a model like CoRAG (assuming it involves some form of coreference resolution or similar complex text processing task) shows consistent gains regardless of the quality (size or strength) of its retriever component (whether E5-base or E5-large), this might suggest that the model is not significantly benefiting from stronger retrieval capabilities. Instead, if there's no significant improvement in performance when using a more powerful retriever, it could imply that the core algorithm and structure are robust enough to compensate for weaker retrieval systems rather than needing strong support.

In other words, if CoRAG's gains persist across different levels of strength or quality of its retriever, this might suggest that:
- The model's effectiveness is largely independent of the retriever's capabilities.
- It compensates well even with potentially suboptimal retrieval components.
  
This does not necessarily mean it synergizes perfectly with strong retrievers, but rather indicates a reliance more on its own processing and less on an externally supplied retrieval system.
