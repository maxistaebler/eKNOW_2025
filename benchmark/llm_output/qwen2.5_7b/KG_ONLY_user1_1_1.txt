The use of automated rejection sampling for generating intermediate chains can indeed introduce confirmation bias. This is because such a method relies heavily on predefined criteria for accepting or rejecting samples during the generation process. These criteria might be based on a specific set of rules or heuristics, which could inadvertently favor certain outcomes over others, leading to biased results [Data: Relationships (375, 404); Entities (18, 21)].

In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains offer a more diverse and nuanced approach. Humans can adapt their reasoning based on context and additional insights that automated systems might not consider fully. This flexibility reduces the likelihood of confirmation bias but introduces other forms of variability due to individual differences in interpretation [Data: Entities (5, 7, 18)].

For instance, when generating intermediate chains, human annotators may incorporate complex contextual information or intuitive judgments that are challenging for automated systems to capture. These factors can lead to more balanced and contextually rich reasoning processes compared to purely algorithmic approaches [Data: Relationships (375, 404); Entities (18, 21)].

Overall, while automated rejection sampling has the potential to introduce confirmation bias due to its rigid adherence to predefined rules, human-annotated chains offer a more flexible and context-aware approach. However, both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them often depends on the specific application and available resources [Data: Relationships (375, 404); Entities (18, 21)].
