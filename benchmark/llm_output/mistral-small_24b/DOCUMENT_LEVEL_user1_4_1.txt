Given the information available, it appears that there is no specific data provided about ByteDance Research or the PaSa Project that directly addresses the safeguards preventing exponential compute costs in real-world deployments. However, I can provide some general insights into how such safeguards might be implemented based on common practices in the field of machine learning and computational research.

### Safeguards Against Exponential Compute Costs

In real-world deployments, especially those involving machine learning models like those developed by ByteDance Research, several strategies are commonly employed to prevent exponential compute costs. These include:

1. **Model Optimization**: Techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation can significantly reduce the computational requirements of a model without sacrificing too much performance.

2. **Efficient Algorithms**: Using algorithms that have better time complexity can help manage compute costs. For example, gradient descent methods with adaptive learning rates or second-order optimization techniques can be more efficient than basic gradient descent.

3. **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizing specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs can accelerate computations and reduce the overall time required for training and inference.

4. **Distributed Computing**: Distributing the computational load across multiple machines or nodes can help manage the compute costs by parallelizing the workload.

5. **Resource Management**: Implementing effective resource management strategies, such as dynamic scaling of resources based on demand, can ensure that compute resources are used efficiently.

6. **Regularization Techniques**: Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization can prevent overfitting, which in turn can reduce the need for excessive computational power to achieve good performance.

### Specific Considerations for ByteDance Research

While specific details about ByteDance Research's safeguards are not provided in the data tables, it is reasonable to assume that they employ a combination of the above strategies. Given their involvement in cutting-edge research and development, it is likely that they have implemented robust mechanisms to manage compute costs effectively.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the data does not provide specific information about ByteDance Research's safeguards against exponential compute costs, general practices in the field suggest that a combination of model optimization, efficient algorithms, hardware acceleration, distributed computing, resource management, and regularization techniques are likely employed. These strategies help ensure that real-world deployments remain computationally feasible and cost-effective.
