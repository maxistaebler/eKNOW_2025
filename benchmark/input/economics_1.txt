Social  and  environmental  prospects  for  commercial  rangelands:  A  modelling assessment

Abstract

This paper presents an integrated modelling assessment that estimated the sensitivities of five endogenous factors in commercial rangelands, i.e. number of active farmers, profits,  stocking  rate,  standing  herbage  biomass,  and  soil  erosion,  to  the  same percentage  variation  in  70  factors,  including  economic  and  climate  drivers.  The assessment utilised a system dynamics model (107 equations) which represents an area of extensive private farms, its farmers, the main local markets on which they trade, and key ecosystem services involved. The assessment procedure consisted in analysing the behaviours of 288,000 variants of this system during 300 years, each under a different economic and climate scenario.

Our  key  findings  were  as follows: 1)  It is likely that at least annual grasslands  will suffer  environmental  degradation  in  the  future,  and  that  such  degradation  will  be primarily  caused  by  climate  change,  not  by  the  increasing  demand  for  livestock products; 2) Private farming systems provide social and economic security to farmers against the effects of climate change, especially in a scenario of rising prices of animal products. However, this research will remain incomplete until its methods and results can be contrasted with other similar assessments.

1. Introduction

Rangelands can be defined in different ways (Sayre et al., 2017; Herrick et al., 2012). However, the definition given by Pratt et al. (1966), namely "land carrying natural or semi-natural vegetation which provides a habitat suitable for herds of wild or domestic ungulates", is good enough for the purposes of this paper. Rangelands contribute to the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people (between 0.7 and 2 billion according to Engler and von Wehrden (2018)), and provide ecosystem services such as forage, fresh water, medicinal products, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, hunting, traditional lifestyles, or tourist experiences  (Sala et al., 2017).  Estimates of the total global area of rangelands vary widely (Reid et al., 2014), not always due to differences in  its  definition.  Thus, for example, Asner et al. (2004) state that managed grazing occupies 25% of the global land surface whereas Engler et al. (2018) put this figure at 44.1%. In any case,  rangelands  are  the form of land use with the largest geographic extent (Ferner et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2014; Asner et al., 2004). Most of the world's grazing area (78%  according to Asner et al. (2004))  is in drylands, i.e. areas  where precipitation  is  typically  unpredictable  and  the  ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration  is  less than 0.65,  as defined by the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).

Rangelands are being  affected by several  global  drivers  of change, namely  climate change,  the increasing demand for food and renewable  energy,  technological change and  the mobility of global capital.  Climate change is expected to cause a decrease in precipitation, and increases in potential evapotranspiration, the variability of rainfall and the frequency  and  duration  of  droughts  in  most  rangelands.  Thus,  climate  change  would aggravate the aridity of these areas worldwide (Reid et al., 2014; Maestre et al., 2012).

The increasing demand for livestock products, which is  caused by a  growing human population and by a shift in diets, especially in the developing world, pushes the prices of animal products up  (Reid et al., 2014;  FAO, 2012).  The increasing demand for cereals, fibre and renewable energy, along with technological change and the mobility of  global capital,  are already  causing  a "revolutionary" conversion  of rangelands to

other land uses, especially crop production (Reid et al., 2014; Herrick et al., 2012).

It  is difficult to assess  the likely social and environmental  impacts  of these global drivers  on rangelands. Higher prices of animal products would increase the generally low  incomes  of farmers  and pastoralists. But greater aridity would  have the contrary

effect,  because  it  would  reduce  the  amount  of  grazing  resources  and  make  their provision more uncertain. The outcome of these opposite forces will likely determine the extent to which people, especially young people, continue leaving rangelands (Reid et al., 2014),  and  the rate of conversion  to other land uses.  Producers  with higher incomes  would  be  encouraged  to  intensify  production,  particularly  by  increasing livestock  numbers  and  by  supplementary  feeding  (Reid  et  al.,  2014).  What environmental impacts would such intensification have on rangelands? Many authors state that it would increase the risk of land degradation (Engler et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2016; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Vetter, 2005; Illius and O'Connor, 1999), but others disagree (Sullivan and Rohde, 2002; Perevolotski and Seligman, 1998). In any case, defining degradation in a variable system is challenging (Gillson and Hoffman, 2007), and highly subjective (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Reynolds and Stafford Smith, 2002; Perevolotski and Seligman, 1998). On the other hand, the possibility of changing the land use offers new opportunities to rangeland inhabitants and prospects of significant short-term economic benefits, but the environmental effects of such a conversion could be  catastrophic  if it is carried out in lands  that  are susceptible to  losing soil through erosion (Herrick et al., 2012).

Clearly,  the  impacts  of  global  drivers  on  rangelands  will  depend  on  what  are  the characteristics of the land, the temporal and  spatial scales, and the groups  of interest considered (Reynolds and Stafford Smith, 2002). Thus, the question arises whether it is possible to gain general insights into such impacts. In this paper, we present a study that seems to give an affirmative answer to this question, and which was based on the following three premises:

 i. System sensitivities hold crucial clues. For example, one of our estimates is that soil erosion is around eight hundred times more sensitive to an increase in rainfall variability than to an increase, by the same percent, in the world/regional price of meat (Section 3). Hence, climate change would pose a much greater environmental threat to rangelands than  the  growing  demand  for  animal  products  (with  the  corresponding  increase  in livestock numbers).

 ii.  Simulation  models  are  needed.  Estimating  system  sensitivities  by  performing statistical  methods on data collected from a representative sample of sites pose major problems. Indeed, an enormous amount of data is required to take account of the many ecological  and  socio-economic  factors  involved,  their  relationships  and  variability;

much of these data are unavailable, especially social and economic data; and, after all, global drivers could result in changes that were not observed in the past (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Oomen et al., 2016; Tietjen and Jeltsch, 2007; Williams and Albertson, 2006; Vetter, 2005).

iii. An integrated  multidisciplinary  approach  is needed. This has been, and still is, widely advocated in the rangeland literature (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Ferner et al., 2018; Berrouet et al., 2018;  Herrero and Thornton, 2013;  Maestre et al., 2012; Herrick et al., 2012; Dougill et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2007; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Gillson  and  Hoffman,  2007; Vetter, S., 2005).  However,  integrated  studies  are rare, mainly because of a lack of communication across disciplines (Vetter, S., 2005). Integration means to take account of the key exogenous and endogenous factors in a rangeland system, and their relationships. An exogenous factor, i.e. a driver in the sense given here, in accordance with Stafford Smith et al. (2007), influences the rangeland but is  not, or is hardly,  influenced  by  it;  an  endogenous factor is  influenced  by other endogenous factors and, possibly, by some of the exogenous ones. It follows from these definitions  that  the stocking rate is never a driver,  but  an endogenous factor whose determinants  could  differ between  rangeland systems.  Thus,  at least in commercial rangelands,  which  would  currently  amount  to  45.5%  of  the  total  global  area  of rangelands (Engler et al., 2018), but which are undergoing major expansion (Sayre et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2014; Dougill et al., 2010; Vetter, 2005; Ellis and Swift, 1988), diverse economic, managerial and climatic factors interact to determine stocking rates. Among the economic and managerial factors there are drivers such as world/regional prices, and the advent of technologies,  production systems,  or  policy  environments (Stafford Smith et al.,  2007);  and  endogenous factors such as local prices, density of farmers/pastoralists, their economic character, i.e. conservative or opportunistic, level of inputs,  or  profits.  Hence,  at  least  in  commercial  rangelands,  an  integrated  socioenvironmental impact assessment should lead to comparisons of the sensitivities of key endogenous factors (including stocking rates) to diverse drivers, similar to that given to illustrate our first premise. However, notable exceptions notwithstanding, e.g. Dougill et al. (2010), there is a lack of such a kind of assessments. As we will see, a side effect of this deficiency might be that the undeniable potential for livestock to impact rangelands may receive undue emphasis.

In sum, this paper presents a study aimed at assessing, by means of an integrated model, the sensitivities of key endogenous factors in private commercial farms, i.e. number of

active farmers, profits, stocking rate, standing herbage biomass, and soil erosion, to 70 biophysical,  economic  and  behavioural  factors,  including  specific  characteristics  of global drivers of change, e.g. level of and variability in world/regional prices, depth of and variability in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, or severity and return period of droughts. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides outlines of the model and  the assessment procedure. Results are presented in Section 3,  and discussed  in Section 4.  Finally, the main conclusions drawn from the study are summarized  in Section  5.  Because  of  space  constraints,  a  detailed  description  of  the  model,  the complete  list of model  parameters, and details about the assessment procedure  are provided in a Supplementary Document.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Outline of the model

The model represents a commercial farming area, its farmers, the main local markets on which they trade, and key ecosystem services involved. Climate is characterised by the alternation  of  dry  and  wet  seasons  as  well  as  the  regular  occurrence  of  droughts. Herbage mass is made up  only of annual species  (woody vegetation is periodically removed  by  ploughing  or  fire).  Farms  are  extensive  private  farms  which  produce weaned animals for sale (hereafter, the output), and farmers normally buy and provide supplementary feed for livestock. Herd/flock sizes are mostly changed by trading with breeding  females  (young  females  only  replace  old  females  that  leave  production). Farmers receive subsidies which do not depend on stocking rates.

Although  this  is not  an unreal  grazing  system,  it would be difficult to estimate the fraction of the global area of rangelands that could be characterized in a similar way. Nevertheless,  two  reasons  make  this system  interesting for our assessment. First, it represents  the  final stages  of some ongoing  transformations  in rangelands.  Indeed,  as already indicated, there is a trend worldwide towards converting communal rangelands into extensive private farms (see references above), and the intensification of livestock production favours a replacement of perennial grasses by annuals (Tarrasón et al., 2016; Stafford  Smith  et  al.,  2007;  Vetter,  2005;  Illius  and  O'Connor,  1999;  Milton  and Siegfried, 1994). And second, annual grasslands where livestock mobility is limited and animals are supplemented are considered to be grazing systems with the highest risks of

degradation (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Engler et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2016; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Vetter, 2005; Illius and O'Connor, 1999).

 Costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females

The model comprises 107 equations which result from the integration and upgrading of models  that have already been presented and utilized in previous papers (Ibáñez and Martínez-Valderrama,  2018;  Ibañez  et  al.,  2016;  Ibañez  et  al.,  2014a).  The  model follows the system dynamics approach (e.g. Elsawah et al., 2017), and is lumped spatial (Kelly et al., 2013).  Therefore,  its equations are mostly nonlinear and organized as multiple feedback loops, and the modelled variables are either totals or averages across a certain area, which differ between submodels (see Fig. 1 and below). The model output  consists  of  the  time  trajectories  of  every  endogenous  variable  over  a predetermined simulation period, and the input is a set of parameter values (Fig. 1). There are 87 biophysical, technical, economic and behavioural parameters, including 11

initial values of stock variables. All of them have real-world counterparts except six calibration parameters (see Table SD1 in the Supplementary Document). Parameters are divided into two groups (Fig. 1):

 i.  System  parameters,  which  are  exclusively  involved  in  the  socio-economic  and environmental submodels, and whose purpose is to specify the characteristics of the modelled system for a given simulation, i.e. the total area, the potential number of farmers  (or  farms),  livestock  characteristics  and  needs,  herbage  properties,  soil properties, hill-slope length and gradient, subsidies, default sizes of local markets, and average  responsiveness  of  farmers  and  traders,  i.e.  the  degree  at  which  they  are conservative  or  opportunistic,  on  average.  Besides,  system  parameters  calibrate functional relationships for a given simulation, with each preserving the general nonlinear shape (sigmoid, exponential, etc.) that ensures its outcome is not unrealistic even for extreme values of the explanatory variables, and thus model's internal consistency.

 ii.  Driver  parameters,  which  are  exclusively  involved  in  the  driver  submodel  (see below).

Model equations are divided into three submodels (Fig. 1):

i.  The  driver  submodel  generates  the  values  of  model  drivers  at  every  time  step. Weather drivers, i.e. rainfall depth, rainfall energy and reference evapotranspiration, are modelled to follow  more or less complex random patterns by combining sine wave functions,  whose  driver  parameters  are  amplitudes  and  periods,  with  random distributions, whose driver  parameters are means and standard deviations.  Economic drivers, i.e.  word/regional prices, costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females  (hereafter,  'other  costs')  and  opportunity  costs  of  farmers,  are  modelled  to follow interannual cycles by means of sine wave functions. By way of illustration, the generation of  rainfall depth during a  time step  is as follows. Whether it rains or not during a given time step (equal to 0.0078125 years, or around 2.85 days) is the outcome of a Bernoulli random variable in which  the 'yes' probability follows seasonal and interannual cycles formulated by means of sine wave functions and specified by means of  driver  parameters  (including the severity and return period of droughts). Then, in case that it rains during the  time step,  rainfall depth is sampled from a log-normal

 distribution. This set of equations is a substantial improvement on previous versions.

 ii.  The  socio-economic  submodel  refers to  the whole farming area. It comprises the following  endogenous variables and relationships involving  system  parameters  which are not detailed here for the sake of brevity: a) Total number of active farmers (or active

farms), which are related to profits and opportunity costs; b) Supplies of output and old females, which are related to the  total  number of breeding females  and  amounts of herbage  mass  and  supplementary  feed  available  for  livestock;  c)  Demand  for supplementary feed, which  is  related to the number of animals to be supplemented, availability of herbage, profits and  local  price of this input;  d)  External and internal supplies of,  and demands for,  breeding females, which are related to the number of active farmers, and their entry and exit, profits and local price of breeding females; e) Local prices of output, old animals, supplementary feed, and breeding females, which are related to world/regional prices,  supplies/demands  from the rangeland, temporary stocks  of unsold/undelivered products/inputs, and external  demands/supplies, whose behaviour depend on local prices themselves; f) Total profits in the farming area and profits for an average farmer, which are related to the selling of products, the purchasing of  inputs,  'other costs', local  prices  and  subsidies;  and  g)  Total  number  of  grazing animals  (breeding  and  young  females),  which  are  related  to  the  number  of  active farmers, profits, and price of breeding females. The average stocking rate results from dividing the total number of grazing animals by the area of active farms.

iii.  The  environmental  submodel  refers to a representative hectare within the farming area. It comprises the following endogenous variables and relationships  (again, the involved system parameters are not detailed here): a) Soil moisture, which depends on rainfall, evapotranspiration, soil drainage and surface runoff; b) Remaining soil depth, which depends on the weathering rate of the parent rock but mainly on the erosion rate; and c) Green and dry herbage masses, which depend on soil moisture and stocking rate. The  erosion rate  is related to  surface runoff and to  the remaining soil depth itself, because bulk density increases as soil is lost. Surface runoff is related to rainfall depth, rainfall  energy,  soil moisture and  canopy cover.  Livestock reduce canopy cover  by consuming herbage and by creating bare soil areas.

The  socio-economic  submodel  takes  the  availability  of  herbage  calculated  by  the environmental  submodel  as  the average availability across the farming  area  (Fig. 1). Similarly, the average stocking rate across the farming area calculated by the socioeconomic submodel is the stocking rate used in the environmental submodel (Fig. 1).

2.2. Outline of the assessment procedure

The estimation of system sensitivities was carried out by means of a sensitivity analysis (SA) of the model. This analysis followed a global variance-based method (Gan et al., 2014; Saltelli et al., 2008). The term 'global' indicates that the effect of each parameter Xi  (i  =  1,  ...,  k)  on  a  target  (endogenous)  variable  Y  is  evaluated  by  varying  all parameters in each simulation of the analysis, thereby leading to robust estimates (in contrast to varying one parameter at a time). The term 'variance-based' indicates that the variance of each target variable, V(Y), is decomposed into terms corresponding to the different parameters and their interactions. These terms are commonly summarized by means of two indices: the first order sensitivity index (Si), which measures the firstorder effect of Xi,  i.e.  the expected reduction in V(Y) if Xi  was fixed; and the total sensitivity  index  (STi),  which  measures  the  total  contribution  to  V(Y)  due  to  Xi, including its first-order effect plus all higher-order effects due to interactions. Clearly, the latter index was especially suitable for our assessment. Given that both indices are always positive, they do not show whether a given effect is positive or negative. When needed, this detail was checked by plotting Y against Xi. As estimators of Si and STi (though estimates of the former were dismissed), we used those labelled as B3 by Glen and Isaacs (2012), authors who contrasted the accuracy of 12 pairs of estimators. B3 estimators require simulating the model N(k+2) times, where N is fixed by the user, k is the number of parameters, and 2N is the number of basic scenarios. A basic scenario is a complete  set  of  parameter  values  (one  model  input)  obtained  by  randomly  and independently  sampling a value for each  parameter within a predetermined  range of variation. To this end, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling. The other kN scenarios were obtained by combining the basic scenarios in the way explained by Glen and Isaacs. In our case, N was equalled to 4000, value at which the estimates of the main sensitivities achieved a satisfactory convergence. A 300-year simulation period was used in order to estimate long-term sensitivities.

We  evaluated the sensitivities of five target variables to 70 model parameters. The resting  17  parameters  were  excluded  for  different  reasons  (see  the  Supplementary Document for details). The target variables were the remaining soil depth at the end of the simulation period [mm], and four averages calculated over the entire simulation period, namely those of the  number of active farmers [frm],  average stocking rate (across  the  farming  area)  [LU/ha],  average  standing  herbage  biomass  (across  the farming area) [kg DM·ha -1 ], and annual earnings per active farmer [€·frm -1 ·yr -1 ] (see the Supplementary Document for details on this variable).  All these variables are 'slow'

variables,  which  are  useful  indicators  for  gaining  insights  into  long-term  changes (Reynolds et al., 2007). The SA utilized 288,000 model runs, i.e. N(k+2) where N = 4000 and k = 70. This means that system sensitivities were estimated by analysing the behaviours  of 288,000 variants of the modelled system during 300 years (each one corresponding to a different set of values of the system parameters) under the same number of different external conditions (each one generated on the basis of a different set of values of the driver parameters). Clearly, the power of an analysis like this can only be achieved by means of a simulation model. Note also that running the model under such a large number of scenarios without a single collapse is a strong test of model's internal consistency.

A final point to be stressed is that the estimated sensitivities are normalized, i.e. refer to the  same  percentage  variation  in  all  the  parameters. Specifically,  each  parameter was randomly sampled within a range equal to ± 30% of a default value. Most of the default values were derived from data on Spanish dehesas, which are commercial rangelands of the  northern Mediterranean region (see the Supplementary Document for details). By setting a wide range around every default  value, i.e. by  covering a  great diversity of variants of the modelled system, we intended to make findings that could be generalized beyond our case study, an issue which is discussed in Section 4.

3. Results

Table  1  presents the estimates of STi  for the 20  most important parameters affecting each target variable  of the SA. Regarding these results, we highlight the following points:

 i. Socio-economic target variables, i.e. number of active farmers, profits, and stocking rate, were almost exclusively sensitive to socio-economic factors, though they were scarcely  sensitive  to  the  price  of  supplementary  feed.  Hence,  the  socio-economic component  of  private  farming  systems  would  be  relatively  invulnerable  to  climate change.

<missing-text>

1 World/regional output price; 2 Costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females; 3 Opportunity cost; 4 Bulk density; 5 World/regional supplementary feed price; 6 Delay time for traders to adjust ...; 7 Delay time for farmers to adjust ...; 8 Time step; 9 Green herbage; 10 Standard deviation; 11 Dry herbage; 12 Soil water content; 13 Dry and bare soil; 14 Coefficient of variation.

 ii. Number of active farmers and profits were mostly sensitive to the same three factors in  the  same  order,  namely  level  of  the  world/regional  price  of  output  (positive relationship), target output per breeding female (positive relationship), and 'other costs' (negative relationship). Subsidies had a much lower effect on both target variables. Hence, unless 'other costs'  increase very considerably, it is likely  that the growing demand  for  animal  products  and  the  corresponding  intensification  of  livestock production  will  economically  benefit  farmers,  and  will  favour  their  permanence  in private farming systems. As stated in point (i), this would be so regardless of climate change. In consequence, it could be taken into consideration the possibility of reducing the level of subsidy.

iii. The stocking rate was mostly sensitive to the same three factors mentioned in (ii), showing the same type of relationships (positive/negative). Hence, again, unless 'other costs' increase significantly, it is likely  that the growing demand for animal products and the corresponding intensification of livestock production will increase livestock numbers in private farming systems.

 iv.  Environmental target variables, i.e. standing herbage biomass and remaining soil depth, were almost exclusively sensitive to biophysical factors. Hence, it is unlikely that the  growing  demand  for  animal  products  and  the  corresponding  intensification  of livestock production will impact on forage supply and soil erosion in private farming systems.

 v. Environmental target variables were especially sensitive to two parameters: 'initial topsoil porosity' and 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow' (abbreviated as 'BD  threshold  herbage'  in  Table  1).  These  parameters  were  practically  the  only biophysical parameters whose effects on the socio-economic target variables, though relatively unimportant, ranked among the top 20 effect list. The importance of both parameters is explained as follows. Given that the parametric scenarios used in the SA were ultimately based on random sampling, in some simulations (specifically, in 83,679 simulations), the value of 'initial topsoil porosity' entailed an initial topsoil bulk density which, by chance, exceeded the value of 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow'.  Therefore,  in  the  variants  of  the  modelled  system  corresponding  to  these simulations, the soil was entirely denuded of herbage cover from the very beginning. Moreover, it is likely that, in some other simulations (variants), the value of 'initial topsoil porosity' meant that topsoil bulk density was initially below the threshold but sufficiently close to it for the disappearance of herbage mass to happen within the

simulation period (recall from Section 2.1 that topsoil bulk density increases as soil is eroded). Hence, the combined effect of the parameters in question can be interpreted as the effect of a shortage of herbage mass. As a corollary, it is likely that shortages of herbage mass caused by a decrease in precipitation will seriously affect soil masses in private farming systems, though will leave their socio-economic components relatively unaffected.

vi. Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), standing herbage biomass was mostly  sensitive  to  'average  rainfall  depth  per  time  step'  (positive  relationship), 'average reference evapotranspiration depth per time step' (negative relationship) and 'average  probability  of  rainfall  during  one  time  step'  (positive  relationship).  By comparison,  parameters  related  to  rainfall  variability,  including  those  related  to droughts, were relatively unimportant. Hence, it is likely that a decrease in precipitation will significantly reduce the availability of forage, at least in annual grasslands.

vii. Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), soil depth was mostly sensitive to rainfall variability, i.e. to 'standard deviation of rainfall depth per time step' (negative relationship). By comparison, parameters related to the amount of rainfall per time step, i.e. 'average probability of rainfall during one time step' and 'average rainfall depth per time step of rain', which showed negative relationships with soil depth, were relatively unimportant. Hence, it is likely that climate change will increase erosion rates, at least in annual grasslands, because the effect of a decrease in precipitation in reducing soil erosion  will  likely  not  compensate  for  the  increases  caused  by  a  rise  in  rainfall torrentiality and more exposed soils.

Finally, we should add that the sensitivity of soil depth to the level of the world/regional price of meat was 0.0003 (not included in Table 1). Hence, soil erosion would be around eight hundred times less sensitive to this factor than to rainfall variability, as stated in Section 1.

4. Discussion

Overall, the key findings from our modelling assessment are:

Finding  #1:  It  is  likely  that  at  least  annual  grasslands  will  suffer  environmental degradation in the future, and it is likely that such degradation will be primarily caused by climate change, and not by the increasing demand for livestock products.

Finding #2: Private farming systems provide social and economic security to farmers against the effects of climate change, especially in a scenario of rising prices of animal products.

Although the simulation results shown in Section 3 strongly support these findings, they can only be taken as broad statements because modelling invariably involves making simplifying assumptions  and dealing with unknowns.  Therefore,  it is  recognized  that increases  in livestock numbers could  significantly contribute to land degradation  in certain areas or periods of time, and that other types of grazing systems, e.g. communal systems, could also cope with climate change.

We have not found other studies  that support or contradict Finding #1. Many  have evaluated  the  likely  effects of climate change and stocking rates  on  the provision of ecosystem services in rangelands  (see references in Section 1). But  it seems that no previous study has compared the environmental effects of climate change with those of changes in the drivers of stocking rates,  even  though this  is  an  essential assessment, because  the  stocking  rate  is  an  endogenous  factor,  not  a  driver  (Section  1).  Our contribution consisted in estimating the sensitivities of five key endogenous factors in commercial rangelands, including stocking rate, to the same percentage variation in 70 factors,  including  economic and climate drivers.  In doing so,  each factor could be ranked and compared in importance with others. However, it was beyond the scope of this study to review long-term projections on economic and climate variables. Thus, the question of whether the percentage variations in the former might exceed in the future the percentage variations in the latter to the point that grazing effects will keep up with, or exceed, climate change effects remains unanswered. All we can say here is that it is unlikely  (Finding  #1),  because  the  estimated  sensitivities  of  the  endogenous environmental factors to climate drivers turned out to be hundreds of times greater than those to the economic ones.

Finding  #2  may  come  as  no  surprise,  if  only  because  supplementary  feeding  is  a common strategy for coping with weather variability (Martínez-Valderrama et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2015;  Kachergis  et al., 2014).  On the disadvantage side, Finding #2 implies that farmers would not perceive degradation as a concern, whatever its cause may be. This can be a serious problem affecting commercial agriculture in general, as has been pointed out by some authors (Ibáñez et al., 2014b; Vetter, 2005). However, noting that the model takes for granted that farmers respond exclusively to economic indicators,  our assessment shows  that, in general terms, such a behaviour  would not

pose a major threat to the provision of ecosystem services in private farming systems (Finding #1).

It  should  be  clear  that  our  study  did  not  aim  at  comparing  the  advantages  and disadvantages of different grazing systems, simply because just  a single  system was evaluated. Therefore, Finding #2 could only be an argument supporting the conversion of  communal rangelands into private  farms  if there is convincing evidence  that the former  system  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  And  to  find  such  evidence,  more integrated assessments are necessary. In the only study of this type that we know of, Dougill et al. (2010), by also making use of an integrated dynamic model, found that communal systems in the Kalahari region are much more vulnerable to climate change than private farms, even under a market growth scenario, and suggest land privatization as well as  a  greater sharing of knowledge from  private  to  communal  producers  as solutions.

Our assessment relies on the adequacies of a model and an assessment procedure. Thus, it is worth considering their strengths and weaknesses, and the extent to which the latter could affect our key findings. Let's start by saying that the model exclusively includes processes and relationships that are widely accepted (well documented) or grounded on a compelling logic. This is why issues such as the possible effects of livestock grazing on water use efficiency and species composition of herbage mass were  disregarded. These are highly  controversial issues for which, today, there is no widely accepted explanation (Ferner et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Oñatibia and Aguiar, 2016; Reid et al.,  2014;  Vetter,  2005;  Sullivan  and  Rohde,  2002;  Illius  and  O'Connor,  1999; Perevolotski  and  Seligman,  1998;  Milchunas  and  Lauenroth,  1993;  Wilson  and MacLeod,  1991).  Nevertheless,  with  hindsight,  simulation  results  suggest  that  both issues would be relatively unimportant when considered within a wide context. Indeed, note that the  model formulates the herbage growth rate (out of bare soil areas)  as a fraction of the parameter 'potential growth rate of green herbage'. Such a fraction varies with soil moisture over the simulation period. Thus, it equals one, i.e. the actual herbage growth rate equals the potential rate, only if soil moisture is at field capacity and no soil, i.e. no water storage capacity, has been lost by erosion. Otherwise, the fraction is less than one,  reaching  zero  whenever  soil water content is at wilting point  or when soil mass runs out (see Eq. 29 in the Supplementary Document for details). Therefore, for the model to reflect that livestock affect water use efficiency or cause an undesirable change  in  herbage  composition,  the  fraction  in  question  should  be  related  to  the

historical stocking rate, apart from soil moisture, e.g. the additional condition for it to be one would be that the whole area is ungrazed. But the parameter 'potential growth rate of green herbage'  (abbreviated as 'GH pot. growth rate' in Table 1)  had a negligible effect in all target variables except, needless to say, on standing herbage biomass. Hence, incorporating the mentioned relationship could hardly change the key findings of our assessment. The same reasoning  would apply  then  to  other factors affecting herbage  productivity  such as increased CO2  levels  (Maestre et al., 2012;  Tietjen and Jeltsch, 2007), the loss of soil nutrients caused by erosion (Illius and O'Connor, 1999) or soil compaction (Pulido et al., 2016). Soil compaction also increases runoff, resulting in  higher erosion rates  (Asner, 2004).  But it is unlikely that incorporating a direct positive relationship between the historical stocking rate and surface runoff could cause socio-economic drivers to enter the list of important effects on soil erosion. This is suggested by the  relatively  low sensitivity  that  soil depth  showed  to  the  parameters involved in determining surface runoff (Table 1).

The approach adopted for our assessment to consider temporal and spatial variability tried  to  avoid  significantly  increasing  model  complexity,  data  requirements  and unknowns, whereas maintaining the intended generality of the assessment. As explained in Section 2.1, for a given simulation, the model generates temporal variability in drivers, and thus in the entire system, on the basis of a set of parameter values. Also, the representative hectare to which the environmental submodel applies is characterized by means of parameter values for each simulation. Thus, by varying all such values, the SA took account of the long-term evolution of 288,000 hectares differing in the length and gradient of the hill-slope, and in the properties of herbage mass and soil, under the same number of different climate and stocking scenarios. This approach implies sacrificing temporal and spatial precision to generality and realism (Levins, 1966), but it is suitable for a modelling assessment that is aimed at improving understanding of the modelled system and of the way it is expected to react to changes in system drivers (Kelly et al., 2013).

An  unavoidable  weakness  of  the  model  is  that  many  things  are  assumed  to  be invariable.  Thus,  the  model  does  not  allow  the  production  system,  the  policy environment, the technology, or parameter values to change over the simulation period (300 years). However, it does not seem that these simplifications, strong as they may be, can affect the key findings of our study. Indeed, regarding the production system, it can be expected that climate change will encourage farmers to adopt additional strategies for

dealing with a variable climate, apart from supplementary feeding.  The most salient options  are  substituting part of the business based on selling weaned animals for a yearling business, diversifying activities on the farm, and using shorter grazing periods (Kachergis et al., 2014; Torell et al., 2010; Müller et al., 2007). But given that these are profitable  practices  aimed  at  enhancing  the  resilience  of  farming  operations  and rangeland ecosystems to increasing weather variability, the assumption that farmers will tend to adopt them can only reinforce our key findings.

Concerning  the policy environment,  it is likely that, under a scenario of a growing demand for livestock products, it will be necessary the incorporation of policies aimed at preventing excessive stocking rates in certain areas or during certain periods of time (recall that Finding #1 is a broad statement). Thus, for example, the European Common Agricultural Policy has already incorporated  the cross-compliance system by which payments are conditional upon respecting EU law on environmental, public and animal health, animal welfare and land management  (https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture). However, because this kind of policies protect both farmers' income stability and lands, again the assumption that they will be adopted in the future would reinforce our key findings. Similarly, given that technology helps improve labour efficiencies and make better use of inputs,  the prospect that  new livestock technology will be adopted by farmers would not affect our findings, at least in principle.

Let's consider now the constancy of parameters. We will focus on those parameters that showed  important effects on target variables, but  are not  driver  parameters,  whose constancy was intended, or initial values, for obvious reasons. These are 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow', 'erosion rate calibration parameter' and 'target for the output per LU'  (see Table 1). The first two  parameters  represent features of the modelled hectare. Certainly, they could change over time in certain circumstances. But taking them as invariable  conforms to the intended generality of our assessment.  In contrast, it is likely that farmers will aim at maximizing 'target for the output per LU' in the  future,  because  it  showed  a  positive  effect  on  profits.  Changing  the  breed  of livestock offers a limited scope for improvement. The most effective alternative would be to incorporate a yearling business, a possibility that has already been commented.

It was explained in Section 2.2 that, although most of the default parameter values used for the assessment were derived from data on a specific case study (Spanish dehesas), we intended to make findings that could be generalized beyond this case. To this end, the parametric scenarios for the SA were generated by sampling each parameter within

a wide range around its default  value (±30%), i.e. by covering a great diversity of variants of the modelled system  and  of the external scenarios.  This  procedure  seems acceptable for known or approximated parameters, which are the majority (see Table SD1 in the Supplementary Document),  but  what about the unknown  parameters?  It would take long to present a careful examination, so, for the sake of brevity, we will only stress that, fortunately, no unknown parameter ranked among the most important ones, thereby suggesting that our key findings would not be unduly affected by a lack of knowledge.

Our  assessment  was not aimed at  evaluating  the impacts of the mobility of  global capital and the increasing demand for certain crops and renewable energy. However, it is possible to make two final  comments in regard  to such drivers.  First,  it is worth noting  that,  in  the  assessment,  default  values  of  the  managerial  parameters  (4 parameters) defined farmers as conservative, on average, i.e. as relatively unresponsive to expected profits. More specifically, the default scenario specified  that  farmers  are cautious of changing the size of the reproductive herd or the amount of supplementation provided to animals. In so doing, we just reflected the type of farmers depicted by the interviews with farm owners that provided part of the available data (Ibáñez et al., 2014a).  Ibáñez and Martínez-Valderrama  (2018), by utilizing a section  of the same model  used  here,  found  that  a  widespread  conservatism  would  be  optimal  for commercial farming areas from economic, social, and ecological perspectives. Thus, it is possible that farmers have managed to find this optimum in areas with a long history of grazing, as is the case of Spanish dehesas. The same authors found that the opposite group  behaviour, i.e. a widespread opportunism,  would  perform better economically, but worse socially and ecologically. It is unlikely that traditional  farmers  will  ever decide to adopt an opportunistic strategy, which is risky and requires special skills and experience  to  master.  However,  the  mobility  of  global  capital  might  result  in  the purchase of rangelands by investors that take livestock as a mere asset, among whom a widespread opportunism could prevail. It is unlikely that our key findings would apply to  these  rangelands. Second, we have seen that, in general terms, cautiously-managed grazing  systems  would  provide  social  and  economic  benefits  without  reducing  the provision of ecosystem services to society. This is a key argument against a careless conversion of  rangelands to crop production, a conversion that  has  often resulted  in social crises and environmental collapses (Herrick et al., 2012; Reynolds et al., 2007; Rowntree et al., 2004).

5. Conclusions

Rangeland research should address the lack of studies aiming at comparing the social and environmental effects of drivers of change in rangelands, where 'driver' means factor that affects the rangeland but is not affected by it. Clearly,  livestock  have an undeniable potential for impacting  rangelands,  and  it is crucial to investigate such potential effects.  But  because  the stocking rate is not a driver, it is also crucial to investigate the environmental  effects of changes in  its  determinants.  In commercial rangelands, such determinants are economic, climatic and managerial, so integrated assessments, particularly integrated modelling assessments, are required. The need for taking  social  issues  into  consideration  additionally  advocate  a  multidisciplinary integration.

In this paper, an integrated modelling assessment has been presented. The research has proved very fruitful, and led to clear findings (see Sections 3 and 4). However, it will remain incomplete until its methods and results can be contrasted with other similar assessments
