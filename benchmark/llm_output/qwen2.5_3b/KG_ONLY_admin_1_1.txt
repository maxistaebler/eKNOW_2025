The provided data tables do not contain specific information related to automated rejection sampling or confirmation bias specifically, nor do they detail the quality of reasoning chains generated by systems like HAI-LLM, LLM-RankFusion, or AGILE frameworks. The data primarily focuses on entities and their roles in different methods and platforms rather than comparative analysis of algorithmic versus human-generated reasoning.

However, I can draw some commentary from available information about the methodology:

Automated rejection sampling is a technique used to generate intermediate chain generation in AI systems. It involves selecting a subset of generated chains based on certain criteria (usually quality metrics) which could potentially introduce confirmation bias if these criteria favor existing or popular reasoning paths rather than genuinely novel, unbiased ones.

In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains are created by humans who evaluate and approve the intermediate steps. This process inherently incorporates human judgment and experience, which can lead to more nuanced and contextually appropriate decisions about what constitutes a valid or insightful chain of reasoning. Human annotators often look for clear logical progression, relevance to the overall task, and evidence of understanding in each step.

Given these observations, it is plausible that automated rejection sampling might introduce confirmation bias if the quality metrics used favor paths already known to be correct or popular. This would mean the AI system is more likely to generate chains consistent with existing knowledge rather than genuinely novel ones. In this sense, human-annotated reasoning chains are generally less susceptible to such biases as they rely on explicit evaluations by humans.

To summarize, while automated methods can be efficient and scalable, their susceptibility to confirmation bias without proper oversight or quality metrics makes them potentially biased compared to human-annotated systems, which inherently aim for unbiased evaluation based on human judgment. The exact degree of this bias depends on the specific implementation details but generally speaking, human review introduces a layer of critical thinking that machine algorithms might lack.

For more precise insights into whether confirmation bias is an issue with automated methods versus humans, additional research and analysis would be needed to compare empirical results from these different methodologies directly.
