The persistence of gains in CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation) across different retriever qualities, such as E5-base and E5-large, can indeed provide insights into how the framework interacts with retrievers. However, it does not necessarily imply that CoRAG compensates for weak retrievers rather than synergizing with strong ones. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Compensation vs. Synergy**: If CoRAG shows consistent gains regardless of whether the retriever is E5-base or E5-large, it could mean that:
   - The framework has mechanisms that effectively utilize even limited retrieval capabilities.
   - There might be a ceiling effect where improvements from stronger retrievers are not fully leveraged by CoRAG.

2. **Framework Robustness**: Persistent gains across different retriever qualities suggest that the framework is robust and can handle varying levels of retrieval performance. This robustness could be due to:
   - Effective integration of retrieved information.
   - Strong contextual understanding within the generation process.

3. **Synergy with Strong Retrievers**: Even if gains are consistent, it does not rule out synergy with strong retrievers. It might simply mean that the benefits from stronger retrievers are more incremental rather than dramatic. For example:
   - Stronger retrievers could provide higher-quality information, leading to marginally better outputs.
   - The framework might already be optimized for average retrieval performance, so additional improvements from stronger retrievers do not translate into significant gains.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The consistency of gains should also be evaluated in the context of specific metrics and tasks. Different metrics (e.g., accuracy vs. fluency) might show different patterns of improvement with varying retriever strengths.

To better understand whether CoRAG compensates for weak retrievers or synergizes with strong ones, it would be helpful to:
- Analyze performance differences between E5-base and E5-large in more detail.
- Examine specific cases where stronger retrievers provide clear advantages.
- Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of retrieval quality on CoRAG's performance.

In summary, while persistent gains across different retriever qualities suggest robustness, it does not definitively indicate compensation over synergy. Further analysis is needed to draw more precise conclusions.
