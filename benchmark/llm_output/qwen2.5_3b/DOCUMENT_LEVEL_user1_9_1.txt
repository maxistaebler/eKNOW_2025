The data provided focuses primarily on information related to ByteDance Research and the PaSa Project [Data: Sources (15, 16), Reports (1); Relationships (23)]. There is no direct information available that addresses whether CoRAG's success in knowledge tasks can be extended to creative domains or if its reliance on retrieval inherently limits its generative versatility compared to pure Large Language Models (LLM). Therefore, I cannot generate a response based solely on the provided data.
