CoRAG (Contextualized Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a method designed to handle complex queries that require multiple hops of reasoning. Unlike traditional retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods which primarily rely on context retrieval for the initial query response, CoRAG incorporates contextualized embeddings from large language models to enhance the multi-hop reasoning capabilities. This approach allows for more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of contexts within queries.

In a traditional RAG architecture, the system retrieves relevant documents based on pre-defined similarity metrics (such as cosine similarity between document vectors and query vector). However, this method struggles with complex or nested queries where multiple layers of information are needed to derive an accurate response. For instance, if a question involves understanding the context in one part of text before using that context to understand another part, a traditional RAG might struggle if these segments are not directly adjacent in the document.

CoRAG addresses this limitation by integrating contextual embeddings generated from language models into the retrieval and generation processes. These embeddings provide richer semantic information about the documents and queries, enabling the system to better capture hierarchical dependencies and multi-hop reasoning. For example, when a query involves multiple references or logical steps of understanding (such as understanding a nested structure within text), CoRAG can use these contextual embeddings to bridge gaps between document segments more effectively.

Moreover, in scenarios where traditional RAG might retrieve documents that are not directly relevant to the specific parts needed for multi-hop reasoning, CoRAG's enhanced context retrieval capabilities allow it to find and utilize additional relevant information. This makes CoRAG particularly effective in handling queries with complex nested structures or indirect references.

In summary, CoRAG fundamentally differs from traditional RAG architectures by leveraging contextual embeddings from large language models to improve the ability to perform multi-hop reasoning across multiple layers of documents. This enhances its performance in understanding and generating responses for more intricate and contextually rich queries.
