The persistence of CoRAG's gains across different retriever qualities, specifically between E5-base and E5-large, suggests that CoRAG can perform well regardless of the quality of the retriever. This could imply several things about how CoRAG operates:

1. **Robustness to Weaknesses**: If CoRAG shows similar performance improvements even when using a weaker retriever (E5-base), it may indicate that the framework is designed in such a way that it can mitigate or compensate for the limitations of the underlying retriever. This could mean that CoRAG has mechanisms to enhance relevance or accuracy through other aspects of its architecture, such as effective ranking algorithms, post-processing steps, or additional data augmentations.

2. **Decoupling from Retriever Strength**: The framework might be decoupled in a way that it doesn't strongly rely on the strengths of the retriever. This could involve robust techniques for handling noisy or incomplete results from the retriever, ensuring that the overall system's performance remains consistent across different quality levels.

3. **Synergy with Post-Processing**: Instead of synergizing directly with strong retrievers, CoRAG might focus more on post-processing and fine-tuning steps to improve relevance scores after retrieval. This approach can be advantageous as it leverages a broader range of models (both strong and weak) without needing a perfect retriever.

4. **Generalization and Adaptability**: The framework's consistent gains suggest that it is well-optimized for general use cases, not just top-tier scenarios. It might have mechanisms to adapt its behavior based on the quality of input data or results from the retriever, ensuring performance remains robust across different conditions.

In summary, while CoRAG may benefit from strong retrievers, its consistent gains across E5-base and E5-large suggest that it is likely designed to compensate for weaker retrievers rather than merely relying on synergies with stronger ones. This makes it a versatile framework capable of delivering reliable performance in various retrieval scenarios.
