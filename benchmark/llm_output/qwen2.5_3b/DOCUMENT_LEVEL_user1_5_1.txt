Given the available data, there is no specific information provided to support or refute claims about the performance differences in retrieval quality between models of varying sizes when testing CoRAG (Contextual Retrieval Augmented Generation). The dataset does not contain any records related to comparative analyses of different retriever qualities or their impact on a framework's overall effectiveness. Therefore, based solely on the information available in the provided data tables, it is impossible to determine whether CoRAG compensates for weak retrievers rather than synergizing with strong ones.

To make such claims about model performance and how they interact with different components of a system like retrieval quality, one would need more comprehensive datasets that include comparative tests between models under various conditions. Without this information, any speculation or conclusion drawn is purely hypothetical and unsupported by the provided data.

In summary, based on the input data:
