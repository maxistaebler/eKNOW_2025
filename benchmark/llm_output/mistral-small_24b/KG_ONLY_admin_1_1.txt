Automated rejection sampling in the context of generating intermediate reasoning chains can indeed introduce certain biases, including confirmation bias. Here's a breakdown of how this might happen and how it compares to human-annotated reasoning chains:

### Confirmation Bias in Automated Rejection Sampling

1. **Selection Bias**: If the automated system is designed to reject samples that do not align with pre-existing patterns or expected outcomes, it may inadvertently favor chains that confirm these expectations. This can lead to a confirmation bias where the system preferentially selects reasoning chains that support known or anticipated conclusions.

2. **Overfitting**: The model might overfit to the training data, leading it to generate reasoning chains that are overly specific to the examples it has seen rather than generalizing well to new scenarios. This can result in biased chains that do not accurately represent a broader range of possible reasoning paths.

3. **Lack of Diversity**: Automated systems may struggle to generate diverse and creative reasoning chains, instead producing chains that are similar to those already present in the training data. This lack of diversity can limit the exploration of alternative hypotheses or explanations, reinforcing confirmation bias.

### Comparison to Human-Annotated Reasoning Chains

1. **Human Judgment**: Human annotators bring a wealth of diverse experiences and perspectives to the table. They can often recognize and account for nuances that automated systems might miss, reducing the likelihood of confirmation bias. However, human annotators are also subject to their own biases, which can be influenced by personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and cognitive limitations.

2. **Explicit Reasoning**: Human-annotated chains can include explicit reasoning steps that are more nuanced and contextually aware. This can help in generating more robust and less biased chains compared to automated systems that might rely on statistical patterns alone.

3. **Error Correction**: Humans can correct errors and biases through iterative feedback loops, peer reviews, and continuous learning. Automated systems, while capable of self-improvement through training data updates, may not have the same level of adaptability in real-time scenarios without human intervention.

4. **Creativity and Innovation**: Human annotators can introduce creative and innovative reasoning chains that automated systems might struggle to generate due to their reliance on pre-existing patterns. This creativity can help in exploring new hypotheses and reducing confirmation bias.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate confirmation bias in both automated and human-annotated reasoning chains, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Diverse Training Data**: For automated systems, using a diverse and representative dataset can help reduce overfitting and selection bias.
2. **Bias Detection Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms that detect and correct biases in the generated chains can improve fairness and accuracy.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Incorporating human oversight and feedback into the automated process can help identify and rectify biases more effectively.
4. **Training and Awareness**: For human annotators, providing training on recognizing and mitigating biases can enhance the quality of annotated chains.

In summary, while automated rejection sampling can introduce confirmation bias, it is not inherently worse than human-annotated reasoning chains, which also have their own set of biases. The key is to employ strategies that minimize these biases in both approaches.
