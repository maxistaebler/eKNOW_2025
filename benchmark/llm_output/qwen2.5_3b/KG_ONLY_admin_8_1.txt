The provided data tables do not contain any information related to environmental impact assessments conducted for large-scale deployments of systems or LLMs, such as HAI-LLM. The datasets focus on relationships and entities within the context of an LLM (Large Language Model) system but lack relevant details about deployment impacts.

This means we cannot directly answer the question based on the given data. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:

"This is not supported by any specific records in the provided dataset [Data: HAI-LLM (890), SHAO (875)]. The datasets focus on relationships and entities within an LLM system but do not provide information regarding environmental impact assessments conducted for large-scale deployments."

If more comprehensive data related to deployment processes, including environmental considerations, were available in a different dataset or context, we could provide relevant insights. Otherwise, the current scope of the provided data does not allow us to make any definitive statements about such assessments.
