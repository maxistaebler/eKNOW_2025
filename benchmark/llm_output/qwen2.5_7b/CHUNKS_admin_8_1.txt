Based on the provided data, there is no specific information regarding environmental impact assessments conducted for large-scale deployments of large language models (LLMs). The tables primarily focus on different methodologies and researchers associated with LLMs rather than their deployment or environmental impacts.

However, it's important to note that as the compute requirements for LLMs increase—such as the 128k tokens mentioned—the energy consumption and carbon footprint can significantly rise. Given this context:

- The data does not explicitly mention any assessments related to large-scale deployments.
- There is a general understanding in the research community that increased computational demands could lead to higher environmental costs [Data: Sources (72)].

For a more comprehensive answer, it would be necessary to consult additional sources or reports specifically focused on the environmental impact of deploying LLMs at scale. These might include industry guidelines, academic studies, or policy documents addressing sustainable AI practices.

In summary, while the data provided does not directly address environmental impact assessments for large-scale deployments, there is a recognized need and ongoing research into this area due to the significant computational demands of advanced language models like those requiring 128k tokens [Data: Relationships (18); Sources (72)].
