CoRAG (Contextualized Rank-Attentive Generation) fundamentally differs from traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures by addressing certain limitations related to multi-hop reasoning. While traditional RAG systems typically rely on retrieving and integrating information in a linear or shallow manner, CoRAG is designed to handle more complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks [Data: Relationships (741); Entities (881, 594)].

Specifically, CoRAG addresses retrieval limitations such as the limited depth of context that traditional RAG can effectively manage. Traditional RAG architectures often face challenges when dealing with information spread across multiple documents or requiring a series of hops to form a complete understanding [Data: Relationships (741)]. CoRAG incorporates mechanisms for rank-attentive generation, allowing it to retrieve and integrate deeper contextual information more efficiently. This is achieved through enhanced retrieval strategies that prioritize relevant sources while minimizing the impact of irrelevant data.

In summary, CoRAG improves upon traditional RAG by providing a more robust framework for handling multi-hop reasoning tasks, thereby overcoming some of the retrieval limitations inherent in simpler RAG architectures [Data: Relationships (741); Entities (881, 594)].
