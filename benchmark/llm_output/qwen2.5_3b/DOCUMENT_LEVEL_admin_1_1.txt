Automated rejection sampling in the context of machine learning or artificial intelligence often involves using probabilistic models to generate sequences or samples (like generating text) based on certain rules or distributions. In the case of intermediate chain generation for a language model, automated rejection sampling might involve randomly drawing from a distribution over possible chains until an acceptable one is obtained.

Confirmation bias refers to the tendency to favor information that confirms preexisting beliefs and ignore disconfirming evidence. While this concept applies broadly across human cognition and reasoning, it can also be observed in the development of machine learning models and automated processes, including those using rejection sampling or other probabilistic methods for generating text or sequences.

In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains represent a more transparent process where humans provide direct feedback on what is deemed correct or relevant. This approach can potentially lead to a broader range of perspectives being considered because the annotators are actively engaging with and evaluating multiple potential solutions rather than relying solely on an automated selection mechanism.

Regarding comparison between automated rejection sampling and human-annotated reasoning chains:
1. **Transparency vs. Automation**: Human-annotated chains offer greater transparency about the reasoning process, while automated systems can be opaque, especially when dealing with complex or sophisticated models. The latter might introduce confirmation bias if they only confirm results based on what is already favored by their training data.

2. **Bias and Fairness**: Automated methods used in machine learning can sometimes inadvertently favor certain types of outputs or interpretations simply because those are more prevalent in the datasets. Human annotators, however, have the ability to identify biases within the dataset or reasoning process and correct them. They also might provide additional context that is not easily captured by automated systems.

3. **Efficiency vs. Depth**: Automated methods can be faster and scale better for large-scale applications where efficiency is a critical factor. However, they may overlook nuances or complex cases due to their reliance on pre-determined rules and distributions. Human reasoning chains are more flexible and can handle unexpected scenarios well but might require significant time and effort.

4. **Generalizability**: Automated models trained with diverse data sets should theoretically be better at generalizing across different contexts compared to human-annotated methods, which may only provide insights specific to the dataset or context they were tested in.

In summary, while automated rejection sampling can help generate plausible intermediate chain generations efficiently and systematically, it is prone to confirmation bias because it relies on a pre-existing distribution rather than engaging with multiple viewpoints. In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains offer greater transparency, flexibility, and the potential for broader and deeper understanding of the underlying logic or correctness criteria. Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific application and requirements of the task at hand.
