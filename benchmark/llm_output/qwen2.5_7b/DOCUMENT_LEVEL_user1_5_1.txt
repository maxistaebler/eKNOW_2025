The information provided in the table "reports" does not contain specific details regarding CoRAG's performance across different retriever qualities or any analysis comparing E5-base and E5-large models. Therefore, based on the given data, it is not possible to determine whether the framework compensates for weak retrievers or synergizes with strong ones.

To address your question more accurately, we would need additional information from relevant datasets such as "reports" that include comparative evaluations of CoRAG's performance under different conditions. This could help us understand if the gains in performance persist across various quality levels of the retriever and what underlying mechanisms might be at play.

If you have access to other data sources or reports that discuss these aspects, those would provide more insight into your question [Data: Reports (+more)].
