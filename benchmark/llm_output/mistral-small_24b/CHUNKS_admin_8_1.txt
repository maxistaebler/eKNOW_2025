The environmental impact of deploying large-scale language models, such as those requiring 128k tokens for optimal performance, is a significant concern. Several key areas are typically assessed in environmental impact studies for such deployments:

1. **Energy Consumption**:
   - **Training Phase**: Training large language models requires substantial computational resources, often involving thousands of GPUs or TPUs running for extended periods. This results in high energy consumption.
   - **Inference Phase**: Even during the inference phase, where the model is used to generate responses, there can be significant energy usage, especially if the model is deployed on a large scale.

2. **Carbon Footprint**:
   - The carbon footprint of training and deploying these models is often calculated by estimating the amount of COâ‚‚ emissions associated with the energy consumption. This includes both direct emissions from data centers and indirect emissions from the electricity grid.

3. **E-Waste**:
   - Large-scale deployments require significant hardware, which can lead to e-waste when equipment becomes obsolete or fails. The environmental impact of manufacturing new hardware and disposing of old equipment is also considered.

4. **Water Usage**:
   - Data centers often use large amounts of water for cooling systems. This can be a significant environmental concern, especially in regions where water resources are limited.

5. **Land Use**:
   - Building and maintaining data centers require land, which can have impacts on local ecosystems and biodiversity.

6. **Supply Chain Impacts**:
   - The production of hardware components involves various materials and processes that have their own environmental footprints, including mining for rare earth metals and the manufacturing of semiconductors.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate these impacts, several strategies are often employed:

1. **Energy-Efficient Hardware**: Using more energy-efficient GPUs and TPUs can reduce overall energy consumption.
2. **Renewable Energy Sources**: Powering data centers with renewable energy sources like solar or wind can significantly reduce the carbon footprint.
3. **Optimized Algorithms**: Developing algorithms that require less computational power for training and inference.
4. **E-Waste Management**: Implementing recycling programs and designing hardware for easier disassembly and recycling.
5. **Water-Efficient Cooling Systems**: Using more water-efficient cooling technologies or even air-cooling systems in suitable climates.

### Specific Studies

While I don't have access to specific studies conducted for large-scale deployments of models requiring 128k tokens, several general studies on the environmental impact of AI and machine learning exist. For example:

- **Strubell et al. (2019)**: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with training large neural networks.
- **Henderson et al. (2020)**: This paper discusses the environmental impacts of data centers and potential mitigation strategies.

For detailed assessments specific to your deployment, it would be advisable to consult recent research papers or reports from organizations involved in AI ethics and sustainability, such as the Partnership on AI or the Green Grid.
