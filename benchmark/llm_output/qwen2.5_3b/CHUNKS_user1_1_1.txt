The process of using automated rejection sampling for generating intermediate chain generation can indeed lead to certain forms of bias similar to those found in human behavior. However, understanding these biases is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and reliability of such methods.

From the data provided, there are no specific references or detailed information regarding how the use of automated rejection sampling impacts confirmation bias compared to human-annotated reasoning chains. The sources table (Source 0) mentions a search task related to sparse reward papers but does not provide details on automated rejection sampling or its comparison with human-generated reasoning chains.

Given this limited information, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about the potential introduction of confirmation bias in such processes. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that both human-annotated and automated methods could introduce biases due to various factors including data limitations, model preconceptions, and decision-making algorithms used by automated systems.

In scenarios where human reasoning chains are annotated for evaluation, several factors mitigate potential biases:
1. **Subjectivity of Human Annotations**: Humans can interpret the context differently based on their experiences, knowledge, and perspectives.
2. **Bias in Annotation Guidelines**: If not carefully defined, guidelines for annotating reasoning chains could introduce subjective bias.

In contrast, automated rejection sampling might avoid some forms of human bias but is susceptible to algorithmic biases that are inherent within the system itself or specific training data used by these systems. This includes issues like preconceptions embedded during model training and decisions made by algorithms in processing large datasets.

To evaluate whether confirmation bias is more prevalent in either method, comprehensive studies comparing both approaches would be necessary. These studies should measure various factors such as transparency of decision-making processes, variability across different iterations or data sets, and overall effectiveness in generating accurate intermediate chains while minimizing biases.

Given the current lack of specific evidence from records related to automated rejection sampling versus human-annotated reasoning chains, a robust comparison requires additional research focused on these comparative aspects. Without this information, we can only speculate based on known behavioral characteristics associated with both methods.
