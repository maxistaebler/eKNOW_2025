The information provided does not contain specific details about safeguards preventing exponential compute costs in real-world deployments related to the claimed log-linear relationship between token consumption and performance. However, I can provide some general insights based on common practices in the field.

In practice, ensuring that computational costs do not escalate exponentially involves several strategies:

1. **Efficient Model Design**: Utilizing efficient architectures and algorithms can help manage computational resources more effectively. For instance, using techniques like quantization to reduce model size or employing pruning methods to remove redundant weights without significantly affecting performance.

2. **Resource Allocation Strategies**: Implementing dynamic resource allocation based on the current workload can optimize the use of hardware resources. This involves monitoring token consumption and adjusting allocated compute power accordingly to avoid over-provisioning.

3. **Batching Techniques**: Batching multiple requests together before processing them can reduce overhead and improve overall efficiency, thus managing computational costs more effectively.

4. **Optimization Algorithms**: Employing advanced optimization algorithms that are specifically designed to handle large-scale data efficiently can significantly mitigate the risk of exponential cost increases.

5. **Cost-Aware Training Practices**: Adopting cost-aware training practices such as using more efficient loss functions or optimizing hyperparameters can also help in managing computational costs.

Given the lack of specific references in the provided dataset, these points are based on general knowledge and common industry practices rather than data from the given sources.

For a more detailed analysis, one would need to consult additional sources that specifically address the topic of computational cost management in large-scale language models.
