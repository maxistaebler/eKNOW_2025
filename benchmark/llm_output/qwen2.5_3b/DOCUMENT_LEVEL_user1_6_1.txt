The provided data tables do not contain any specific information about iterative rejection sampling or its impact on various question-answering (QA) datasets, such as 2WikiMultihopQA. The dataset includes information related to the "ByteDance Research and the PaSa Project," which does not address the specifics of iterative rejection sampling's performance in QA tasks.

When analyzing iterative rejection sampling’s effect across different QA datasets, we would need empirical data that includes the performance metrics for various datasets under this sampling method. Without such data, it is challenging to determine if iterative rejection sampling improves 2WikiMultihopQA and degrades other datasets, or whether these observations are indicative of diminishing returns in chain quality.

The impact of iterative rejection sampling can vary significantly based on factors including the complexity of the QA task, the nature of the dataset (e.g., multihop vs. single-hop), and how well the algorithm captures the necessary information from each sample iteration. It is important to conduct thorough empirical evaluations with relevant datasets to substantiate such claims.

In summary, we lack sufficient data to confirm or refute any specific observations regarding iterative rejection sampling’s effects on 2WikiMultihopQA versus other datasets. For definitive conclusions about its efficacy and potential diminishing returns in QA tasks, further research with appropriate experimental setups is necessary.
