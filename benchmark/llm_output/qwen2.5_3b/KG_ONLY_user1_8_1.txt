The provided data does not contain any specific information regarding environmental impact assessments for deploying systems like HAI-LLM, LLMs, or other related technologies. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support an answer based on the available dataset.

For a comprehensive understanding of potential environmental impacts, additional research would be necessary that focuses specifically on deployment and operational aspects of these technologies rather than just their computational requirements [Data: 18 (HAI-LLM), 594 (HAI-LLM); Relationships (23); Claims (2, 7, 46, +more)]. 

Environmental assessments for large-scale deployments typically involve a variety of factors such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, water usage, and waste production. Organizations that develop and deploy these technologies often have sustainability initiatives in place to mitigate their environmental footprint.

In conclusion, without detailed information on environmental impact studies related to the technologies mentioned, it is not possible to provide specific answers regarding assessments conducted for large-scale deployments of HAI-LLM or similar systems.
