In Section 2, we outline the model. Then, in Section 3, we explore the results of our experiments. In particular, we first look at a technology shock to answer the question of which of the channels outlined above prevails under different regimes, and then we move to the transmission of a fiscal and a monetary policy shock to study what the addition of the portfolio choice implies for the transmission of fiscal and monetary policies. We conclude by outlining how this analysis could be extended in future works.\n\n2 The benchmark model\n\nIn this section, we present the model economy. As the main action takes place on the household side of the economy, we will be mainly focusing on detailing this. The production side follows the standard New-Keynesian specification (see Gal'ı, 2015), with CES final good producers and monopolistically competitive Rotemberg-pricing intermediate good firms. The government side will be modeled as a fiscal authority that chooses the quantity of nominal government debt and tax revenues, as in Hagedorn (2021), to finance exogenous government spending.\n\n2.1 Households\n\nThe household's side is modeled in a way that can be defined as Luetticke (2020) meets Bilbiie et al. (2022). This means that we are going to borrow the infrequent capital trading friction from the former and introduce it into the latter model of limited heterogeneity. In particular, we are going to focus on a three-agent model, in which households will switch between three states with exogenous transition probabilities governed by the matrix Λ with generic component 𝜆 𝑖, 𝑗 for ( 𝑖, 𝑗 ) ∈ { 𝐻, 𝑆, 𝐾 } 2 as the transition probability of moving from state 𝑖 to state 𝑗 . The difference among the three agents is going to be in their ability to access financial markets to insure against future income shocks. In particular, capitalists (indexed by 𝐾 ) can access capital markets in a way that allows them to adjust both their bond and capital holdings, whereas savers (indexed by 𝑆 ) will only be able to adjust and ripe the returns from government bonds. Furthermore, we assume that only capitalists are the firm's shareholders and receive their profits. Finally, hand-to-mouth agents ( 𝐻 ) will consume their labor income every period, as well as their accumulated savings income from bonds before transitioning to the hand-to-mouth state. It is in this sense that we define government bonds as a liquid asset and capital as an illiquid one, i.e., in terms of their consumption-smoothing insurance value to households.\n\nWe think of each type of agent as living on an island populated by their own type. Bonds can be carried across such islands, though they can only be adjusted on islands 𝐾 and 𝑆 , and, as\n\nsuch, forward-looking agents will consider the consumption risk moving forward in their portfolio decisions. The benefits from holding capital, instead, can only be enjoyed on the 𝐾 island, therefore presenting a trade-off between the higher return commanded by its illiquidity and the desire to smooth consumption across states. 4 Given our tractable set-up, we will be able to highlight analytically the link between consumption risk and the liquidity premium in this economy.\n\n2.1.1 Population and financial accounting\n\nWe can think about the three types of consumers as inhabiting three distinct islands. We normalize the total population in the economy to 1 and denote with Π 𝑖,𝑡 for 𝑖 ∈ { 𝐻, 𝑆, 𝐾 } the share of the population on each of the islands. Given our normalization, we have that Π 𝐻,𝑡 = 1 -Π 𝑆,𝑡 -Π 𝐾,𝑡 . The evolution of each of these two shares follows the following laws of motion:\n\nΠ 𝐾,𝑡 + 1 = 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 Π 𝐾,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝑆,𝐾 Π 𝑆,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝐻,𝐾 ( 1 -Π 𝐾,𝑡 -Π 𝑆,𝑡 ) (1)\n\nΠ 𝑆,𝑡 + 1 = 𝜆 𝐾,𝑆 Π 𝐾,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝑆,𝑆 Π 𝑆,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝐻,𝑆 ( 1 -Π 𝐾,𝑡 -Π 𝑆,𝑡 ) . (2)\n\nWe look for the stationary distribution by setting Π 𝑖,𝑡 + 1 = Π 𝑖,𝑡 = Π 𝑖 in the system above, which can be solved for the stationary shares as a function of the exogenous transition probabilities. From now onward, when referring to population shares, we mean the stationary ones, therefore omitting time subscripts.\n\nWe follow the notation in Bilbiie (2024) and Bilbiie et al. (2022) and call 𝐵 𝑗 𝑡 + 1 , for 𝑗 ∈ { 𝐾, 𝑆 } , the per-capita nominal beginning-of-period 𝑡 + 1 bond holdings: after the consumption-saving choice, and also after changing state and pooling with the other agents of the same type.\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "allows us to isolate this channel in the transmission of business cycle shocks, which is more difficult to do with a quantitative HANK model.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we outline the model. Then, in Section 3, we explore the results of our experiments. In particular, we first look at a technology shock to answer the question of which of the channels outlined above prevails under different regimes, and then we move to the transmission of a fiscal and a monetary policy shock to study what the addition of the portfolio choice implies for the transmission of fiscal and monetary policies. We conclude by outlining how this analysis could be extended in future works.\n\n2 The benchmark model\n\nIn this section, we present the model economy. As the main action takes place on the household side of the economy, we will be mainly focusing on detailing this. The production side follows the standard New-Keynesian specification (see Gal'ı, 2015), with CES final good producers and monopolistically competitive Rotemberg-pricing intermediate good firms. The government side will be modeled as a fiscal authority that chooses the quantity of nominal government debt and tax revenues, as in Hagedorn (2021), to finance exogenous government spending.\n\n2.1 Households\n\nThe household's side is modeled in a way that can be defined as Luetticke (2020) meets Bilbiie et al. (2022). This means that we are going to borrow the infrequent capital trading friction from the former and introduce it into the latter model of limited heterogeneity. In particular, we are going to focus on a three-agent model, in which households will switch between three states with exogenous transition probabilities governed by the matrix Λ with generic component 𝜆 𝑖, 𝑗 for ( 𝑖, 𝑗 ) ∈ { 𝐻, 𝑆, 𝐾 } 2 as the transition probability of moving from state 𝑖 to state 𝑗 . The difference among the three agents is going to be in their ability to access financial markets to insure against future income shocks. In particular, capitalists (indexed by 𝐾 ) can access capital markets in a way that allows them to adjust both their bond and capital holdings, whereas savers (indexed by 𝑆 ) will only be able to adjust and ripe the returns from government bonds. Furthermore, we assume that only capitalists are the firm's shareholders and receive their profits. Finally, hand-to-mouth agents ( 𝐻 ) will consume their labor income every period, as well as their accumulated savings income from bonds before transitioning to the hand-to-mouth state. It is in this sense that we define government bonds as a liquid asset and capital as an illiquid one, i.e., in terms of their consumption-smoothing insurance value to households.\n\nWe think of each type of agent as living on an island populated by their own type. Bonds can be carried across such islands, though they can only be adjusted on islands 𝐾 and 𝑆 , and, as\n\nsuch, forward-looking agents will consider the consumption risk moving forward in their portfolio decisions. The benefits from holding capital, instead, can only be enjoyed on the 𝐾 island, therefore presenting a trade-off between the higher return commanded by its illiquidity and the desire to smooth consumption across states. 4 Given our tractable set-up, we will be able to highlight analytically the link between consumption risk and the liquidity premium in this economy.\n\n2.1.1 Population and financial accounting\n\nWe can think about the three types of consumers as inhabiting three distinct islands. We normalize the total population in the economy to 1 and denote with Π 𝑖,𝑡 for 𝑖 ∈ { 𝐻, 𝑆, 𝐾 } the share of the population on each of the islands. Given our normalization, we have that Π 𝐻,𝑡 = 1 -Π 𝑆,𝑡 -Π 𝐾,𝑡 . The evolution of each of these two shares follows the following laws of motion:\n\nΠ 𝐾,𝑡 + 1 = 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 Π 𝐾,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝑆,𝐾 Π 𝑆,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝐻,𝐾 ( 1 -Π 𝐾,𝑡 -Π 𝑆,𝑡 ) (1)\n\nΠ 𝑆,𝑡 + 1 = 𝜆 𝐾,𝑆 Π 𝐾,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝑆,𝑆 Π 𝑆,𝑡 + 𝜆 𝐻,𝑆 ( 1 -Π 𝐾,𝑡 -Π 𝑆,𝑡 ) . (2)\n\nWe look for the stationary distribution by setting Π 𝑖,𝑡 + 1 = Π 𝑖,𝑡 = Π 𝑖 in the system above, which can be solved for the stationary shares as a function of the exogenous transition probabilities. From now onward, when referring to population shares, we mean the stationary ones, therefore omitting time subscripts.\n\nWe follow the notation in Bilbiie (2024) and Bilbiie et al. (2022) and call 𝐵 𝑗 𝑡 + 1 , for 𝑗 ∈ { 𝐾, 𝑆 } , the per-capita nominal beginning-of-period 𝑡 + 1 bond holdings: after the consumption-saving choice, and also after changing state and pooling with the other agents of the same type."

The fiscal stimulus now induces a larger income effect on the hand-to-mouth, which pushes the liquidity premium further down and makes the 'self-insurance' channel stronger. Under both fiscal policy scenarios, capitalists now substitute bonds with capital, which generates substantially larger fiscal multipliers compared to the active monetary policy simulations.\n\nFinally, we look at the effects of a monetary policy shock. A monetary easing that reduces the interest rate has a direct effect on the liquidity premium, which falls. This induces a shift of the capitalists towards capital, which increases the investment in the economy. The increase in the price level reduces the real value of government debt, which in turn decreases the supply of bonds, making them even less attractive than capital. The strength of this supply channel, however, depends on the fiscal policy stance.\n\nComparing the simulations, under all experiments, of the proposed three-agent economy with the ones implied by a standard two-agent one demonstrates the importance of the 'self-insurance' transmission channel we focus our analysis on. In the two-agent economy, the 'self-insurance' channel is not active, and the liquidity premium between illiquid capital and liquid government bonds is only driven by the supply of public debt. As a result, in the two-agent economy, aggregate dynamics are mainly driven by monetary policy and do not depend on the fiscal policy stance. We show that this is not the case in the three-agent model, where aggregate dynamics now depend on the joint fiscal-monetary mix, given the presence of the 'self-insurance' channel in affecting the dynamics of the liquidity premium.\n\nTherefore, our analysis highlights that, in the current policy environment characterized by substantial fiscal expansions in response to the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, central\n\nbanks should also consider the impact of the 'self-insurance' channel on the liquidity premium when setting the monetary policy stance.\n\n1.1 Literature review\n\nUnderstanding monetary-fiscal policy dynamics is crucial to the formulation and implementation of effective policy measures aimed at promoting economic growth and stability. We see our paper contributing and merging two streams of the existing literature, i.e., the study of monetary and fiscal interactions and the aggregate consequences of households' portfolio choices, both of which are extremely prolific.\n\nFirst, we delve into the evolving discourse surrounding the interplay between monetary and fiscal policies. Initially, Sargent and Wallace (1981) introduced the notion of 'unpleasant monetarist arithmetic,' illustrating the quandary faced by a central bank dedicated to curbing inflation while needing to accommodate inherently inflationary fiscal policies. Building upon this, Sargent (1984) extended the discussion to show how shifts in fiscal policy could undermine a central bank's commitment to maintaining low inflation. This research underscored the significance of fiscal policy expectations in influencing the efficacy of monetary policy, adding a crucial dimension to the discourse on the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies. Subsequently, Leeper (1991) introduced the concepts of 'active' and 'passive' monetary and fiscal policies and illustrated how both monetary and fiscal policies are endogenously determined within a model. Leeper's analysis highlighted the pivotal role of the chosen policy regime, whether fiscal or monetary policy is active or passive, in shaping the economy's response to shocks.\n\nBuilding upon these foundations, a further series of studies explored the implications of policy rules and regime switching in the context of monetary and fiscal policy interactions (Davig and Leeper, 2006, 2011; Bianchi and Melosi, 2019; Bianchi et al. , 2020).\n\nInstead of going down the route of regime-switching models, our contribution to this literature, leveraging the work of Hagedorn (2021), consists of extending the static exploration of policy interactions beyond the traditional set of parameters' space. As discussed above, allowing the\n\ngovernment to set fiscal policy in nominal terms induces price level determinacy in the model, even with passive monetary policy.\n\nThen, our study adds to the dialogue on the aggregate consequences of households' portfolio decisions in the presence of assets varying by their liquidity attributes. The role of government debt as liquidity, previously addressed by Woodford (1990), has recently gained renewed attention, as evidenced by studies such as Bayer et al. (2023), Bilbiie et al. (2022) and Bilbiie (2024). Importantly, the 'self-insurance' we study here is also present in Bayer et al. (2023) and subsequent work like Auclert et al. (2024). 3 While they strive to quantitatively identify the liquidity channel's influence on the effectiveness of fiscal policy using a model with a fully heterogeneous population of households, our study adopts an approach more closely aligned with that of Bilbiie et al. (2022) and Bilbiie (2024), focusing on limited heterogeneity among household types. This method allows us to retain key elements of the larger, more complex models while clearly illustrating the 'self-insurance' mechanism of transmission. In doing so, we also offer a methodological contribution by extending the Bilbiie (2024)'s set-up to a three-agent (or state) setting. This gives us the possibility to derive an intuitive and analytical expression linking the liquidity premium to the consumption risk of agents and to show that a two-agent setup is not enough to capture the 'self-insurance' channel we focus on in this analysis. Moreover, our analytical tractable setup allows us to isolate this channel in the transmission of business cycle shocks, which is more difficult to do with a quantitative HANK model.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we outline the model. Then, in Section 3, we explore the results of our experiments. In particular, we first look at a technology shock to answer the question of which of the channels outlined above prevails under different regimes, and then we move to the transmission of a fiscal and a monetary policy\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": ". The fiscal stimulus now induces a larger income effect on the hand-to-mouth, which pushes the liquidity premium further down and makes the 'self-insurance' channel stronger. Under both fiscal policy scenarios, capitalists now substitute bonds with capital, which generates substantially larger fiscal multipliers compared to the active monetary policy simulations.\n\nFinally, we look at the effects of a monetary policy shock. A monetary easing that reduces the interest rate has a direct effect on the liquidity premium, which falls. This induces a shift of the capitalists towards capital, which increases the investment in the economy. The increase in the price level reduces the real value of government debt, which in turn decreases the supply of bonds, making them even less attractive than capital. The strength of this supply channel, however, depends on the fiscal policy stance.\n\nComparing the simulations, under all experiments, of the proposed three-agent economy with the ones implied by a standard two-agent one demonstrates the importance of the 'self-insurance' transmission channel we focus our analysis on. In the two-agent economy, the 'self-insurance' channel is not active, and the liquidity premium between illiquid capital and liquid government bonds is only driven by the supply of public debt. As a result, in the two-agent economy, aggregate dynamics are mainly driven by monetary policy and do not depend on the fiscal policy stance. We show that this is not the case in the three-agent model, where aggregate dynamics now depend on the joint fiscal-monetary mix, given the presence of the 'self-insurance' channel in affecting the dynamics of the liquidity premium.\n\nTherefore, our analysis highlights that, in the current policy environment characterized by substantial fiscal expansions in response to the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, central\n\nbanks should also consider the impact of the 'self-insurance' channel on the liquidity premium when setting the monetary policy stance.\n\n1.1 Literature review\n\nUnderstanding monetary-fiscal policy dynamics is crucial to the formulation and implementation of effective policy measures aimed at promoting economic growth and stability. We see our paper contributing and merging two streams of the existing literature, i.e., the study of monetary and fiscal interactions and the aggregate consequences of households' portfolio choices, both of which are extremely prolific.\n\nFirst, we delve into the evolving discourse surrounding the interplay between monetary and fiscal policies. Initially, Sargent and Wallace (1981) introduced the notion of 'unpleasant monetarist arithmetic,' illustrating the quandary faced by a central bank dedicated to curbing inflation while needing to accommodate inherently inflationary fiscal policies. Building upon this, Sargent (1984) extended the discussion to show how shifts in fiscal policy could undermine a central bank's commitment to maintaining low inflation. This research underscored the significance of fiscal policy expectations in influencing the efficacy of monetary policy, adding a crucial dimension to the discourse on the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies. Subsequently, Leeper (1991) introduced the concepts of 'active' and 'passive' monetary and fiscal policies and illustrated how both monetary and fiscal policies are endogenously determined within a model. Leeper's analysis highlighted the pivotal role of the chosen policy regime, whether fiscal or monetary policy is active or passive, in shaping the economy's response to shocks.\n\nBuilding upon these foundations, a further series of studies explored the implications of policy rules and regime switching in the context of monetary and fiscal policy interactions (Davig and Leeper, 2006, 2011; Bianchi and Melosi, 2019; Bianchi et al. , 2020).\n\nInstead of going down the route of regime-switching models, our contribution to this literature, leveraging the work of Hagedorn (2021), consists of extending the static exploration of policy interactions beyond the traditional set of parameters' space. As discussed above, allowing the\n\ngovernment to set fiscal policy in nominal terms induces price level determinacy in the model, even with passive monetary policy.\n\nThen, our study adds to the dialogue on the aggregate consequences of households' portfolio decisions in the presence of assets varying by their liquidity attributes. The role of government debt as liquidity, previously addressed by Woodford (1990), has recently gained renewed attention, as evidenced by studies such as Bayer et al. (2023), Bilbiie et al. (2022) and Bilbiie (2024). Importantly, the 'self-insurance' we study here is also present in Bayer et al. (2023) and subsequent work like Auclert et al. (2024). 3 While they strive to quantitatively identify the liquidity channel's influence on the effectiveness of fiscal policy using a model with a fully heterogeneous population of households, our study adopts an approach more closely aligned with that of Bilbiie et al. (2022) and Bilbiie (2024), focusing on limited heterogeneity among household types. This method allows us to retain key elements of the larger, more complex models while clearly illustrating the 'self-insurance' mechanism of transmission. In doing so, we also offer a methodological contribution by extending the Bilbiie (2024)'s set-up to a three-agent (or state) setting. This gives us the possibility to derive an intuitive and analytical expression linking the liquidity premium to the consumption risk of agents and to show that a two-agent setup is not enough to capture the 'self-insurance' channel we focus on in this analysis. Moreover, our analytical tractable setup allows us to isolate this channel in the transmission of business cycle shocks, which is more difficult to do with a quantitative HANK model.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we outline the model. Then, in Section 3, we explore the results of our experiments. In particular, we first look at a technology shock to answer the question of which of the channels outlined above prevails under different regimes, and then we move to the transmission of a fiscal and a monetary policy"

This extension is needed to capture the 'self-insurance' channel at the center of our analysis. This channel is present in quantitative HANK models like Bayer et al. (2023) and Auclert\n\net al. (2024). We show that a two-agent set up is not enough to capture it and that our analytically tractable three-agents setup allows us to isolate this channel in the transmission of business cycle shocks, which is more difficult to do with a quantitative HANK model.\n\nBy considering different combinations of the monetary-fiscal regime together with the portfolio choice, we can indeed isolate this transmission mechanism that works via the liquidity premium. Due to the liquidity friction, government bonds are the preferred asset to build up a buffer stock of savings to partially insure against idiosyncratic uncertainty. Therefore, policy regimes that worsen the consumption ability of the hand-to-mouth by lowering their labor income or their bond income from previous states would increase the demand for self-insurance of the capitalist type, leading to a shift in their portfolios towards more liquid assets, ceteris paribus. This is what we will label the 'self-insurance' channel, and it works through asset demand. In the analysis, we highlight the importance of this 'self-insurance' channel for the dynamics of the liquidity premium, taken as encompassing the trade-off between investing in liquid and illiquid assets, deriving an equation that relates it directly to consumption differentials across types. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive such an intuitive relation linking the liquidity premium to household consumption differentials in a HANK model.\n\nSecondly, the policy regime will also determine the change in the supply of nominal government debt due to the change in the interest payment on its stock and the strength through which the government will curb the movement in debt. This is the standard 'supply' channel, and it will have a further effect on the liquidity premium as the asset returns will have to adjust for markets to clear. This second channel would be present even in a representative agent/complete markets version of the model. As a result, in our model, the liquidity premium is driven by the combination of two competing channels. One that works through asset demand ('self-insurance') and the other via asset supply. Different policy mixes will affect the relative strength of these two channels and, therefore, provide different results in terms of the relationship between the liquidity premium and the portfolio choice of households.\n\nWe then use the model to highlight the challenges for the conduct of monetary policy and answer\n\nquestions regarding the aggregate implications of the combination of these two portfolio channels under different monetary and fiscal regimes. In our first experiment, we simulate and explore the implications of technology shock. Our objective is two-fold. On the one hand, we want to gauge the relative strength of the two channels highlighted above under different policy regimes. On the other hand, we want to explore the relative strength of the trade-off between the 'self-insurance' channel via government bonds and the alternative 'insurance-through-investment' channel. The latter comes from the fact that whilst a decline in liquid assets has a negative effect in principle because of the lower ability of agents to smooth consumption, a concomitant increase in capital investment may represent an indirect, general equilibrium form of insurance by potentially increasing the demand for labor and therefore the income of the hand-to-mouth type.\n\nThrough this experiment, we show first that in regimes in which there is a large change in government debt, as when the monetary policy changes the interest rate strongly, and the fiscal policy does not intervene through taxes (active monetary, less passive fiscal regime), the supply channel reinforces the gap in the liquidity premium, inducing the profit motive of the capitalist to prevail. In this case, an increase in the liquidity premium leads capitalists to move towards less liquid assets, spurring an increase in investment. Regimes for which the change in government debt is more tamed, however, see a dominance of the self-insurance mechanism, whereby a worsening of the risky state induces a shift of capitalists towards the more liquid asset. Then, we show that in our model, in which we adopt a standard Cobb-Douglas production function, the 'investment-through-insurance' channel discussed above is very weak due to the poor complementarity between the two productive assets. This implies that the building of more capital stock does not represent a viable substitute for liquid savings for agents in the hand-to-mouth state.\n\nIn our second experiment, we look at the effects of a fiscal stimulus with different combinations of the monetary/fiscal policy mix. An increase in government spending that produces a strong income effect for the hand-to-mouth agents reduces the 'self-insurance' channel and induces capitalists to swap bonds for capital. At the same time, the fiscal stimulus increases the bond supply. We show that, once again, the relative strength of these two effects depends on the policy mix and has\n\nimportant implications for the conduct of monetary policy, especially in scenarios where fiscal policy is either too rigid or overly accommodative.\n\nWhen monetary policy is active, the supply channel dominates independently from the actions put in place by the fiscal authority. Whereas a less passive fiscal policy generates a larger cumulative fiscal multiplier, capitalists keep investing in bonds at the expense of capital. However, with passive monetary policy, a different picture emerges. The fiscal stimulus now induces a larger income effect on the hand-to-mouth, which pushes the liquidity premium further down and makes the 'self-insurance' channel stronger. Under both fiscal policy scenarios, capitalists now substitute bonds with capital, which generates substantially larger fiscal multipliers compared to the active monetary policy simulations.\n\nFinally, we look at the effects of a monetary policy shock. A monetary easing that reduces the interest rate has a direct effect on the liquidity premium, which falls. This induces a shift of\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "in positive net supply in equilibrium, so there is some notion of a 'portfolio choice', but still in a tractable way. This extension is needed to capture the 'self-insurance' channel at the center of our analysis. This channel is present in quantitative HANK models like Bayer et al. (2023) and Auclert\n\net al. (2024). We show that a two-agent set up is not enough to capture it and that our analytically tractable three-agents setup allows us to isolate this channel in the transmission of business cycle shocks, which is more difficult to do with a quantitative HANK model.\n\nBy considering different combinations of the monetary-fiscal regime together with the portfolio choice, we can indeed isolate this transmission mechanism that works via the liquidity premium. Due to the liquidity friction, government bonds are the preferred asset to build up a buffer stock of savings to partially insure against idiosyncratic uncertainty. Therefore, policy regimes that worsen the consumption ability of the hand-to-mouth by lowering their labor income or their bond income from previous states would increase the demand for self-insurance of the capitalist type, leading to a shift in their portfolios towards more liquid assets, ceteris paribus. This is what we will label the 'self-insurance' channel, and it works through asset demand. In the analysis, we highlight the importance of this 'self-insurance' channel for the dynamics of the liquidity premium, taken as encompassing the trade-off between investing in liquid and illiquid assets, deriving an equation that relates it directly to consumption differentials across types. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive such an intuitive relation linking the liquidity premium to household consumption differentials in a HANK model.\n\nSecondly, the policy regime will also determine the change in the supply of nominal government debt due to the change in the interest payment on its stock and the strength through which the government will curb the movement in debt. This is the standard 'supply' channel, and it will have a further effect on the liquidity premium as the asset returns will have to adjust for markets to clear. This second channel would be present even in a representative agent/complete markets version of the model. As a result, in our model, the liquidity premium is driven by the combination of two competing channels. One that works through asset demand ('self-insurance') and the other via asset supply. Different policy mixes will affect the relative strength of these two channels and, therefore, provide different results in terms of the relationship between the liquidity premium and the portfolio choice of households.\n\nWe then use the model to highlight the challenges for the conduct of monetary policy and answer\n\nquestions regarding the aggregate implications of the combination of these two portfolio channels under different monetary and fiscal regimes. In our first experiment, we simulate and explore the implications of technology shock. Our objective is two-fold. On the one hand, we want to gauge the relative strength of the two channels highlighted above under different policy regimes. On the other hand, we want to explore the relative strength of the trade-off between the 'self-insurance' channel via government bonds and the alternative 'insurance-through-investment' channel. The latter comes from the fact that whilst a decline in liquid assets has a negative effect in principle because of the lower ability of agents to smooth consumption, a concomitant increase in capital investment may represent an indirect, general equilibrium form of insurance by potentially increasing the demand for labor and therefore the income of the hand-to-mouth type.\n\nThrough this experiment, we show first that in regimes in which there is a large change in government debt, as when the monetary policy changes the interest rate strongly, and the fiscal policy does not intervene through taxes (active monetary, less passive fiscal regime), the supply channel reinforces the gap in the liquidity premium, inducing the profit motive of the capitalist to prevail. In this case, an increase in the liquidity premium leads capitalists to move towards less liquid assets, spurring an increase in investment. Regimes for which the change in government debt is more tamed, however, see a dominance of the self-insurance mechanism, whereby a worsening of the risky state induces a shift of capitalists towards the more liquid asset. Then, we show that in our model, in which we adopt a standard Cobb-Douglas production function, the 'investment-through-insurance' channel discussed above is very weak due to the poor complementarity between the two productive assets. This implies that the building of more capital stock does not represent a viable substitute for liquid savings for agents in the hand-to-mouth state.\n\nIn our second experiment, we look at the effects of a fiscal stimulus with different combinations of the monetary/fiscal policy mix. An increase in government spending that produces a strong income effect for the hand-to-mouth agents reduces the 'self-insurance' channel and induces capitalists to swap bonds for capital. At the same time, the fiscal stimulus increases the bond supply. We show that, once again, the relative strength of these two effects depends on the policy mix and has\n\nimportant implications for the conduct of monetary policy, especially in scenarios where fiscal policy is either too rigid or overly accommodative.\n\nWhen monetary policy is active, the supply channel dominates independently from the actions put in place by the fiscal authority. Whereas a less passive fiscal policy generates a larger cumulative fiscal multiplier, capitalists keep investing in bonds at the expense of capital. However, with passive monetary policy, a different picture emerges. The fiscal stimulus now induces a larger income effect on the hand-to-mouth, which pushes the liquidity premium further down and makes the 'self-insurance' channel stronger. Under both fiscal policy scenarios, capitalists now substitute bonds with capital, which generates substantially larger fiscal multipliers compared to the active monetary policy simulations.\n\nFinally, we look at the effects of a monetary policy shock. A monetary easing that reduces the interest rate has a direct effect on the liquidity premium, which falls. This induces a shift of"

This process consists of three key stages: pretraining, supervised finetuning (SFT), and alignment, also known as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). For large language models trained in this paradigm, there could be some helpful properties that, without strong theoretical guarantees, are empirically true and thus helpful for LLMs. Our work is related to attention sink (Xiao et al., 2023). An attention sink refers to a token or set of tokens that disproportionately receive attention from other tokens during the attention mechanism within transformer architectures. In their study, they found that one of the most identifiable tokens was shown to be the initial token. While there are no theoretical guarantees, they propose an intuition that initial tokens are visible and used in all later token generations, making them more readily trained to be attention sinks.\n\nOur work is closely related to CoTdecoding (Wang and Zhou, 2024), which uncovers the CoT-paths by enumerating over\n\nthe top-k alternative tokens and aggregating the responses by scoring the decoded responses with confidence on the final answer. However, our approach differs in three key aspects: (1) we introduce a differentiable sampling method that can be directly integrated with existing inference and training frameworks, (2) we focus on improving model performance in scenarios with a sandbox checker, where aggregating responses is less data-efficient, and (3) our method operates without assumptions about the prompts, even when a chain of thought (CoT) is included, extending beyond the scope of CoT-decoding.\n\n3 Flaming-hot Initiation Regular Execution\n\n3.1 Method\n\nIn this work, we propose a sampling method, Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE), inspired by the attention sink phenomenon (Xiao et al., 2023) that demonstrates the importance of initial tokens.\n\nFIRE first samples the initial token at a very high temperature p ≫ 1 , combined with topk filtering to make the candidate tokens more controllable. At higher temperatures, the candidate tokens are sampled from a probability distribution that approaches uniform sampling. After the initial token is sampled, FIRE proceeds with the decoding stage using a regular temperature setting.\n\nOur approach FIRE is similar to CoTdecoding (Wang and Zhou, 2024) that enumerates the topk candidates of the initial token. However, while CoT-decoding focuses more on the decoding stage and extracting Chain-of-Thought without prompt, our approach FIRE serves as a general differentiable sampling method, which can be combined with existing sampling frameworks and can be more efficient in the training stage where a sandbox checker that judges whether a specific answer is correct or not is available with a cheap cost.\n\nWhile FIRE can be applied to any token in the decoding stage, we restrict its application to the initial token to prevent the generation of random tokens that are wrong in the context. For example, if we apply FIRE after the prefix \"1+2=\", it would sample, in addition to the token \"3\", other tokens like \"4\" or \"5\", which are very likely to be wrong. In contrast, since FIRE is only applied to the initial token, it would unlikely lead to broken sentences or code with syntax errors. In our empirical exper-\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\niments, we found that the initial token frequently consists of words like \"Let's\", \"Sure\", \"So\", and \"The\", which do not directly convey any information. But what these initial tokens affect is the reasoning steps afterward, with the same intuition as StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023).\n\n3.2 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we evaluate our algorithm, FIRE, by addressing several key research questions that guide our experiments.\n\nHow effective is FIRE during inference? We first showcase the effectiveness of FIRE sampling in inference-only scenarios. We tested four opensource models: Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Qwen2) (Yang et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Qwen2.572B) (Yang et al., 2024), DeepSeek-coder-v2Instruct (DeepSeek)(Zhu et al., 2024), and Gemma2-2b-it (Gemma-2)(Team et al., 2024), on a diverse set of datasets, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and MBPP(+) (Austin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023c). In GSM8K and MATH, we extend the prompts with phrase \"Please reason step-by-step\" to ensure CoT reasoning in models' responses, a setting where the original motivation of CoT-decoding becomes less meaningful as CoT paths would naturally occur. For the regular sampling settings, we use a combination of nucleus sampling and top-k sampling.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we conducted a thorough enumeration over hyperparameters, including p , k , and min-p (Huggingface, 2023). Table 1 and Table 2 present the aggregated results, where the reported numbers represent the best outcomes from the enumeration. We observe that FIRE consistently improves\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "two directions, there has been increasing focus on controlled decoding in LLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities during inference, ranging from searchbased approaches applied to policy models (Mudgal et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024) to utilizing value models trained in the alignment phase (Liu et al., 2023a; Feng et al., 2023).\n\nIn this paper, we also focus on inference time; however, our approach extends to the sampling processes used during the training of large language models, as commonly practiced in InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). This process consists of three key stages: pretraining, supervised finetuning (SFT), and alignment, also known as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). For large language models trained in this paradigm, there could be some helpful properties that, without strong theoretical guarantees, are empirically true and thus helpful for LLMs. Our work is related to attention sink (Xiao et al., 2023). An attention sink refers to a token or set of tokens that disproportionately receive attention from other tokens during the attention mechanism within transformer architectures. In their study, they found that one of the most identifiable tokens was shown to be the initial token. While there are no theoretical guarantees, they propose an intuition that initial tokens are visible and used in all later token generations, making them more readily trained to be attention sinks.\n\nOur work is closely related to CoTdecoding (Wang and Zhou, 2024), which uncovers the CoT-paths by enumerating over\n\nthe top-k alternative tokens and aggregating the responses by scoring the decoded responses with confidence on the final answer. However, our approach differs in three key aspects: (1) we introduce a differentiable sampling method that can be directly integrated with existing inference and training frameworks, (2) we focus on improving model performance in scenarios with a sandbox checker, where aggregating responses is less data-efficient, and (3) our method operates without assumptions about the prompts, even when a chain of thought (CoT) is included, extending beyond the scope of CoT-decoding.\n\n3 Flaming-hot Initiation Regular Execution\n\n3.1 Method\n\nIn this work, we propose a sampling method, Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE), inspired by the attention sink phenomenon (Xiao et al., 2023) that demonstrates the importance of initial tokens.\n\nFIRE first samples the initial token at a very high temperature p ≫ 1 , combined with topk filtering to make the candidate tokens more controllable. At higher temperatures, the candidate tokens are sampled from a probability distribution that approaches uniform sampling. After the initial token is sampled, FIRE proceeds with the decoding stage using a regular temperature setting.\n\nOur approach FIRE is similar to CoTdecoding (Wang and Zhou, 2024) that enumerates the topk candidates of the initial token. However, while CoT-decoding focuses more on the decoding stage and extracting Chain-of-Thought without prompt, our approach FIRE serves as a general differentiable sampling method, which can be combined with existing sampling frameworks and can be more efficient in the training stage where a sandbox checker that judges whether a specific answer is correct or not is available with a cheap cost.\n\nWhile FIRE can be applied to any token in the decoding stage, we restrict its application to the initial token to prevent the generation of random tokens that are wrong in the context. For example, if we apply FIRE after the prefix \"1+2=\", it would sample, in addition to the token \"3\", other tokens like \"4\" or \"5\", which are very likely to be wrong. In contrast, since FIRE is only applied to the initial token, it would unlikely lead to broken sentences or code with syntax errors. In our empirical exper-\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\niments, we found that the initial token frequently consists of words like \"Let's\", \"Sure\", \"So\", and \"The\", which do not directly convey any information. But what these initial tokens affect is the reasoning steps afterward, with the same intuition as StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023).\n\n3.2 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we evaluate our algorithm, FIRE, by addressing several key research questions that guide our experiments.\n\nHow effective is FIRE during inference? We first showcase the effectiveness of FIRE sampling in inference-only scenarios. We tested four opensource models: Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Qwen2) (Yang et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Qwen2.572B) (Yang et al., 2024), DeepSeek-coder-v2Instruct (DeepSeek)(Zhu et al., 2024), and Gemma2-2b-it (Gemma-2)(Team et al., 2024), on a diverse set of datasets, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and MBPP(+) (Austin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023c). In GSM8K and MATH, we extend the prompts with phrase \"Please reason step-by-step\" to ensure CoT reasoning in models' responses, a setting where the original motivation of CoT-decoding becomes less meaningful as CoT paths would naturally occur. For the regular sampling settings, we use a combination of nucleus sampling and top-k sampling.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we conducted a thorough enumeration over hyperparameters, including p , k , and min-p (Huggingface, 2023). Table 1 and Table 2 present the aggregated results, where the reported numbers represent the best outcomes from the enumeration. We observe that FIRE consistently improves"

Deepseek-coder-v2: Breaking the barrier of closed-source models in code intelligence. arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.11931 .\n\nA Implementation Details\n\nIn the paper, we proposed FIRE sampling, which is similar to CoT-decoding, and removed the need to calculate the confidence score. One of the biggest benefits of simplifying the method is getting an extremely easy implementation. For inference, we use vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and do a twostage sampling, with the first stage sampling only one token with high temperature and the second stage continuing the sampling with regular sampling. For training, we implement based on HybridFlow(Sheng et al., 2024), a newly released RLHF\n\ncode base, which supports sampling with vLLM. Thus, we only changed the sampling part of the code in the RLHF framework. As shared in all experiments, the temperature used for the initial token is set at 30.\n\nIn our experiment, we enumerate the parameters of top-p sampling, top-k sampling, and minp sampling. We list all the parameters we have tried in the next section. Due to computation costs, some of the models are not enumerated in the same number as others. However, our conclusion that FIRE outperforms regular sampling is consistent, as we will show later. Specifically for MBPP(+), and for Qwen-RL, the model after our fine-tuning, we test on a single hyperparameter combination of top -p = 0 . 9 , top -k = 16 , which follows the best configuration from previous trials. For Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct, we follow the recommended hyperparameters of top -p = 0 . 8 , top -k = 16 . For reinforcement learning problems, we use the default parameters in HybridFlow, specifically, top -k = 16 , top -p = 1 . 0 . For training with FIRE sampling, to enable PPO to accept the relatively out-of-distribution samples, we change the clipping ratio for PPO from 0.2 to 0.5. We observe that for PPO+FIRE to use the original clip rate, it will generally match the original performance, while pure PPO with a higher clip ratio will lead the training to a failure and converge to a pass rate close to 0.\n\nIn the paper, we use three different datasets: GSM8K, MATH, and MBPP(+). GSM8K is a dataset with 8.5K total instances of math problem, of which 7.5K is in the training set and 1.3K is in the test set. MATH is a math dataset that is slightly more difficult and more comprehensive than GSM8K, with 7.5K training data and 5K test data. MBPP is a benchmark consisting of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, and MBPP+ is a benchmark that enlarges MBPP with some harder problems, reaching around 35K total test problems. While MBPP+ is still under regular update, we use version 0.1.0 in our paper.\n\nFor the final part of the experiment about generation in the middle sequence, we use a dataset that guarantees a certain number of sentences of prefixes to be correct. Here, the sentences are defined based on '.' in the answer. This dataset is generated on the training set of the MATH dataset, for which we first use Qwen2-7b-Instruct to sample 10 responses for each question. Then, for each re-\n\nsponse, we enumerate the sentences and sample 20 times using different numbers of sentences as the prefix. Thus, we obtained an approximation of the point at which the original samples became wrong. Specifically, if one response is wrong before the number of lines we enumerate in Table 5, we use all the prefix up to the point that is still correct for that response, i.e., if for a specific sample, the correct sentences are less than 2, 3rd-line pass rate will be calculated in the same way as PRM-line.\n\nB Extra Experiment Results\n\nWe provide our full inference experiment table in Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8. We observe that among all hyperparameter combinations, FIRE stably outperforms regular sampling, starting at Pass@10 to Pass@20 and Pass@40. In most settings, FIRE is superior to regular sampling at Pass@5, and for certain settings in the MATH dataset, FIRE could even show an advantage in Pass@1.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<\n######################\nOutput:",

However, our conclusion that FIRE outperforms regular sampling is consistent, as we will show later. Specifically for MBPP(+), and for Qwen-RL, the model after our fine-tuning, we test on a single hyperparameter combination of top -p = 0 . 9 , top -k = 16 , which follows the best configuration from previous trials. For Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct, we follow the recommended hyperparameters of top -p = 0 . 8 , top -k = 16 . For reinforcement learning problems, we use the default parameters in HybridFlow, specifically, top -k = 16 , top -p = 1 . 0 . For training with FIRE sampling, to enable PPO to accept the relatively out-of-distribution samples, we change the clipping ratio for PPO from 0.2 to 0.5. We observe that for PPO+FIRE to use the original clip rate, it will generally match the original performance, while pure PPO with a higher clip ratio will lead the training to a failure and converge to a pass rate close to 0.\n\nIn the paper, we use three different datasets: GSM8K, MATH, and MBPP(+). GSM8K is a dataset with 8.5K total instances of math problem, of which 7.5K is in the training set and 1.3K is in the test set. MATH is a math dataset that is slightly more difficult and more comprehensive than GSM8K, with 7.5K training data and 5K test data. MBPP is a benchmark consisting of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, and MBPP+ is a benchmark that enlarges MBPP with some harder problems, reaching around 35K total test problems. While MBPP+ is still under regular update, we use version 0.1.0 in our paper.\n\nFor the final part of the experiment about generation in the middle sequence, we use a dataset that guarantees a certain number of sentences of prefixes to be correct. Here, the sentences are defined based on '.' in the answer. This dataset is generated on the training set of the MATH dataset, for which we first use Qwen2-7b-Instruct to sample 10 responses for each question. Then, for each re-\n\nsponse, we enumerate the sentences and sample 20 times using different numbers of sentences as the prefix. Thus, we obtained an approximation of the point at which the original samples became wrong. Specifically, if one response is wrong before the number of lines we enumerate in Table 5, we use all the prefix up to the point that is still correct for that response, i.e., if for a specific sample, the correct sentences are less than 2, 3rd-line pass rate will be calculated in the same way as PRM-line.\n\nB Extra Experiment Results\n\nWe provide our full inference experiment table in Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8. We observe that among all hyperparameter combinations, FIRE stably outperforms regular sampling, starting at Pass@10 to Pass@20 and Pass@40. In most settings, FIRE is superior to regular sampling at Pass@5, and for certain settings in the MATH dataset, FIRE could even show an advantage in Pass@1.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<"

For cleaner intuition of the impulse responses, we assume no smoothing in the interest rate and taxes. In all simulations, tax response to government spending will remain fixed to 𝛾 𝐺𝑇 = 0 . 1 as in Gal'ı et al. (2007). The rest of the parameters of the monetary and fiscal policy rules will vary across exercises. Passive fiscal policy will imply 𝛾 𝑇 = 1 while the less passive regime will have 𝛾 = 0 . 5, which is the lower variable that ensures stability under all the scenarios analyzed below. Active monetary policy uses 𝜓 𝜋 = 1 . 2 while passive 𝜓 𝜋 = 0 . 8. Reducing further the response to inflation will generate much larger effects of fiscal policy.\n\nTransition probabilities are calibrated such that capitalists remain in the 𝐾 island with probability 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 = 0 . 8 or move the 𝐻 one with probability 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 = 0 . 02. Hand-to-mouths instead have 𝜆 𝐻,𝐾 = 0 . 0541 probability to become capitalists and savers 𝜆 𝑆,𝑆 = 0 . 95 to stay savers. The rest of the transition probabilities are set accordingly to ensure that the population shares remain constant. This calibration follows Bilbiie et al. (2023) and Bilbiie (2024) by implying that non hand-to-mouth agents have in beween 2% ( 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 = 0 . 02) and 4% probability of becoming hand-to-mouth ( 𝜆 𝑆,𝐻 = 0 . 0369). 5 In line with data from the Survey of Consumer Finance, we calibrate to 20% of the population living hand-to-mouth, 10% capitalists while the rest is made of savers. 6\n\nStability Analysis As discussed in the introduction, Hagedorn (2021) set up with nominal fiscal policy permits us to extend the static exploration of policy interactions beyond the traditional set of parameters' space. On the other hand, from Bilbiie (2008), we know that the presence of hand-to-mouth households affects the area of determinacy. Therefore, in online Appendix C, we perform a stability analysis of the model under the case of real and nominal fiscal policy. To be able to isolate as well the implications of the introduction of a third type of agent, we also perform the same stability analysis of a two-agent version of the model by setting the share of savers in the economy equal to 0 (and, therefore, Π 𝐾 = 0 . 8). The results show that: i) the inverted Taylor principle ( inverted aggregate demand logic - Bilbiie (2008)) is not present either in the two agents model with nominal fiscal policy or in the three agents model with real fiscal policy; ii) with real fiscal policy both models present four regions as in Leeper (1991) while with nominal fiscal policy we end up with just two regions. As fiscal policy becomes less and less passive ( 𝛾 𝑇 approaching 0), we get instability, but otherwise, determinacy is attained independently of the monetary policy stance. Therefore, as in Hagedorn (2021), allowing the government to set fiscal policy in nominal terms induces price level determinacy in the model even with passive monetary policy.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nTable 1: Calibration\n\n2.6 The dynamics of the liquidity premium\n\nBefore moving on to the model simulations in the following sections, we believe it is helpful to provide a characterization of the dynamics of the liquidity premium to understand better the determinants of the portfolio choice of the capitalists. The liquidity premium in this economy is given by the expected return premium to hold the less liquid asset (capital) relative to the more liquid one (public debt). Therefore we can write it as the ratio between the expected real gross return on capital and the expected real return on government bonds:\n\n𝐿𝑃 𝑡 = E 𝑡 ( 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 + ( 1 -𝛿 ) 𝑄 𝑡 + 1 ) 1 𝑄 𝑡 ( 1 + 𝑅 𝐵 𝑡 ) 1 Π 𝑡 + 1 , (23)\n\nwhere, due to the presence of investment adjustment costs, 𝑄 𝑡 is the price of capital goods relative to consumption goods. For ease of exposition we call the real gross return of the two assets: R 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 = 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 +( 1 -𝛿 ) 𝑄 𝑡 + 1 𝑄 𝑡 and R 𝐵 𝑡 + 1 = 1 + 𝑅 𝐵 𝑡 Π 𝑡 + 1 . As a result the liquidity premium can be written as 𝐿𝑃 𝑡 = E 𝑡 R 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 R 𝐵 𝑡 + 1 .\n\nProposition 1. The dynamics of the liquidity premium can be characterized up to the first order as follows:\n\nˆ 𝐿𝑃 𝑡 = 𝛽 E 𝑡 GLYPH<2> ˜ R 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 -˜ R 𝐵 𝑡 + 1 GLYPH<3> = -𝜎 E 𝑡 GLYP\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "3.5 quarters. For cleaner intuition of the impulse responses, we assume no smoothing in the interest rate and taxes. In all simulations, tax response to government spending will remain fixed to 𝛾 𝐺𝑇 = 0 . 1 as in Gal'ı et al. (2007). The rest of the parameters of the monetary and fiscal policy rules will vary across exercises. Passive fiscal policy will imply 𝛾 𝑇 = 1 while the less passive regime will have 𝛾 = 0 . 5, which is the lower variable that ensures stability under all the scenarios analyzed below. Active monetary policy uses 𝜓 𝜋 = 1 . 2 while passive 𝜓 𝜋 = 0 . 8. Reducing further the response to inflation will generate much larger effects of fiscal policy.\n\nTransition probabilities are calibrated such that capitalists remain in the 𝐾 island with probability 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 = 0 . 8 or move the 𝐻 one with probability 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 = 0 . 02. Hand-to-mouths instead have 𝜆 𝐻,𝐾 = 0 . 0541 probability to become capitalists and savers 𝜆 𝑆,𝑆 = 0 . 95 to stay savers. The rest of the transition probabilities are set accordingly to ensure that the population shares remain constant. This calibration follows Bilbiie et al. (2023) and Bilbiie (2024) by implying that non hand-to-mouth agents have in beween 2% ( 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 = 0 . 02) and 4% probability of becoming hand-to-mouth ( 𝜆 𝑆,𝐻 = 0 . 0369). 5 In line with data from the Survey of Consumer Finance, we calibrate to 20% of the population living hand-to-mouth, 10% capitalists while the rest is made of savers. 6\n\nStability Analysis As discussed in the introduction, Hagedorn (2021) set up with nominal fiscal policy permits us to extend the static exploration of policy interactions beyond the traditional set of parameters' space. On the other hand, from Bilbiie (2008), we know that the presence of hand-to-mouth households affects the area of determinacy. Therefore, in online Appendix C, we perform a stability analysis of the model under the case of real and nominal fiscal policy. To be able to isolate as well the implications of the introduction of a third type of agent, we also perform the same stability analysis of a two-agent version of the model by setting the share of savers in the economy equal to 0 (and, therefore, Π 𝐾 = 0 . 8). The results show that: i) the inverted Taylor principle ( inverted aggregate demand logic - Bilbiie (2008)) is not present either in the two agents model with nominal fiscal policy or in the three agents model with real fiscal policy; ii) with real fiscal policy both models present four regions as in Leeper (1991) while with nominal fiscal policy we end up with just two regions. As fiscal policy becomes less and less passive ( 𝛾 𝑇 approaching 0), we get instability, but otherwise, determinacy is attained independently of the monetary policy stance. Therefore, as in Hagedorn (2021), allowing the government to set fiscal policy in nominal terms induces price level determinacy in the model even with passive monetary policy.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nTable 1: Calibration\n\n2.6 The dynamics of the liquidity premium\n\nBefore moving on to the model simulations in the following sections, we believe it is helpful to provide a characterization of the dynamics of the liquidity premium to understand better the determinants of the portfolio choice of the capitalists. The liquidity premium in this economy is given by the expected return premium to hold the less liquid asset (capital) relative to the more liquid one (public debt). Therefore we can write it as the ratio between the expected real gross return on capital and the expected real return on government bonds:\n\n𝐿𝑃 𝑡 = E 𝑡 ( 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 + ( 1 -𝛿 ) 𝑄 𝑡 + 1 ) 1 𝑄 𝑡 ( 1 + 𝑅 𝐵 𝑡 ) 1 Π 𝑡 + 1 , (23)\n\nwhere, due to the presence of investment adjustment costs, 𝑄 𝑡 is the price of capital goods relative to consumption goods. For ease of exposition we call the real gross return of the two assets: R 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 = 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 +( 1 -𝛿 ) 𝑄 𝑡 + 1 𝑄 𝑡 and R 𝐵 𝑡 + 1 = 1 + 𝑅 𝐵 𝑡 Π 𝑡 + 1 . As a result the liquidity premium can be written as 𝐿𝑃 𝑡 = E 𝑡 R 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 R 𝐵 𝑡 + 1 .\n\nProposition 1. The dynamics of the liquidity premium can be characterized up to the first order as follows:\n\nˆ 𝐿𝑃 𝑡 = 𝛽 E 𝑡 GLYPH<2> ˜ R 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 -˜ R 𝐵 𝑡 + 1 GLYPH<3> = -𝜎 E 𝑡 GLYP"

A key challenge in developing these general capabilities is efficiently sourcing diverse, high-quality data. This becomes especially critical in reasoningrelated tasks with sandbox checkers, such as math or code, where the goal is to generate correct solutions to specific problems with higher probability. In this work, we introduce Flaminghot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE) sampling, a simple yet highly effective method to efficiently find good responses. Our empirical findings show that FIRE sampling enhances inference-time generation quality and also benefits training in the alignment stage. Furthermore, we explore how FIRE sampling improves performance by promoting diversity and analyze the impact of employing FIRE at different positions within a response.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks since the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022). In addition to traditional natural language processing tasks such as summarization and sentiment analysis, LLMs have demonstrated effectiveness in many new domains, including code generation (Chen et al., 2023; Roziere et al., 2023), human-computer interaction (Li et al., 2023), and math problemsolving (Wei et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2024). Although standalone LLMs have limited reasoning capabilities (Sun et al., 2023; Valmeekam et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b), researchers have tried to enhance them by incorporating tool-use and developing integrated systems known as LLM agents (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024), which expands the applications of LLMs to more general domains like robot control (Wang et al., 2023a) and autonomous driving (Mao* et al., 2023).\n\nTo develop general capabilities, LLMs are typically trained through a three-stage process: pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and alignment (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). During pretraining, the model learns from a vast array of data gathered from publicly available sources. Then, in the SFT and alignment stages, the model's abilities are further refined, allowing it to increase reasoning abilities and better follow users' instructions. In order to enhance reasoning tasks, a sandbox checker - a tool used to verify the correctness of solutions - is often used during training (Liu et al., 2023b). Therefore, one of the key challenges in achieving effective and efficient training is determining how to obtain more successful samples within a fixed number of trials, particularly when addressing complex problems.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE), a simple yet effective sampling method for training large language models. Inspired by recent findings on attention sink (Xiao et al., 2023), our approach begins by sampling the initial token at a very high temperature and proceeds with the regular sampling process for the remaining sequence. Our algorithm can be viewed as a simplified and more general version of CoT-decoding (Wang and Zhou, 2024), especially with a focus on training in math and coding domains where a sandbox checker is available at a relatively cheap cost.\n\nWe first show that our method, at inference time, can improve the pass rate within N trials (pass@n), also known as the best-of-N (BoN) when only the correctness of the final answer is considered. To demonstrate its effectiveness in training, we show that it can be directly integrated into the reinforcement learning process of large language models. Our approach proves to be effective across multiple open-source models and various LLM capabilities, including mathematical reasoning and coding. We highlight how our method promotes diversity in\n\ngenerated samples, a key factor linked to performance improvements in pass rate. Importantly, this diversity is maintained even after training with our sampling method, indicating room for further enhancement. We also discuss the effects of simple variations of our method, where the temperature change occurs mid-process rather than at the start, on performance outcomes.\n\n2 Related Works\n\nResearchers have been exploring two primary directions to efficiently improve response quality under a frozen pre-trained LLM. The first direction focuses on prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) and Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023a). The second direction involves letting LLMs fix their own mistakes (Wang et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a). In line with these two directions, there has been increasing focus on controlled decoding in LLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities during inference, ranging from searchbased approaches applied to policy models (Mudgal et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024) to utilizing value models trained in the alignment phase (Liu et al., 2023a; Feng et al., 2023).\n\nIn this paper, we also focus on inference time; however, our approach extends to the sampling processes used during\n######################\nOutput:",

A key challenge in developing these general capabilities is efficiently sourcing diverse, high-quality data. This becomes especially critical in reasoningrelated tasks with sandbox checkers, such as math or code, where the goal is to generate correct solutions to specific problems with higher probability. In this work, we introduce Flaminghot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE) sampling, a simple yet highly effective method to efficiently find good responses. Our empirical findings show that FIRE sampling enhances inference-time generation quality and also benefits training in the alignment stage. Furthermore, we explore how FIRE sampling improves performance by promoting diversity and analyze the impact of employing FIRE at different positions within a response.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks since the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022). In addition to traditional natural language processing tasks such as summarization and sentiment analysis, LLMs have demonstrated effectiveness in many new domains, including code generation (Chen et al., 2023; Roziere et al., 2023), human-computer interaction (Li et al., 2023), and math problemsolving (Wei et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2024). Although standalone LLMs have limited reasoning capabilities (Sun et al., 2023; Valmeekam et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b), researchers have tried to enhance them by incorporating tool-use and developing integrated systems known as LLM agents (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024), which expands the applications of LLMs to more general domains like robot control (Wang et al., 2023a) and autonomous driving (Mao* et al., 2023).\n\nTo develop general capabilities, LLMs are typically trained through a three-stage process: pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and alignment (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). During pretraining, the model learns from a vast array of data gathered from publicly available sources. Then, in the SFT and alignment stages, the model's abilities are further refined, allowing it to increase reasoning abilities and better follow users' instructions. In order to enhance reasoning tasks, a sandbox checker - a tool used to verify the correctness of solutions - is often used during training (Liu et al., 2023b). Therefore, one of the key challenges in achieving effective and efficient training is determining how to obtain more successful samples within a fixed number of trials, particularly when addressing complex problems.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE), a simple yet effective sampling method for training large language models. Inspired by recent findings on attention sink (Xiao et al., 2023), our approach begins by sampling the initial token at a very high temperature and proceeds with the regular sampling process for the remaining sequence. Our algorithm can be viewed as a simplified and more general version of CoT-decoding (Wang and Zhou, 2024), especially with a focus on training in math and coding domains where a sandbox checker is available at a relatively cheap cost.\n\nWe first show that our method, at inference time, can improve the pass rate within N trials (pass@n), also known as the best-of-N (BoN) when only the correctness of the final answer is considered. To demonstrate its effectiveness in training, we show that it can be directly integrated into the reinforcement learning process of large language models. Our approach proves to be effective across multiple open-source models and various LLM capabilities, including mathematical reasoning and coding. We highlight how our method promotes diversity in\n\ngenerated samples, a key factor linked to performance improvements in pass rate. Importantly, this diversity is maintained even after training with our sampling method, indicating room for further enhancement. We also discuss the effects of simple variations of our method, where the temperature change occurs mid-process rather than at the start, on performance outcomes.\n\n2 Related Works\n\nResearchers have been exploring two primary directions to efficiently improve response quality under a frozen pre-trained LLM. The first direction focuses on prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) and Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023a). The second direction involves letting LLMs fix their own mistakes (Wang et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a). In line with these two directions, there has been increasing focus on controlled decoding in LLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities during inference, ranging from searchbased approaches applied to policy models (Mudgal et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024) to utilizing value models trained in the alignment phase (Liu et al., 2023a; Feng et al., 2023).\n\nIn this paper, we also focus on inference time; however, our approach extends to the sampling processes used during"

To answer these questions, we build a heterogenous agents New Keynesian model where three different types of agents can save in assets with different liquidity profiles to insure against idiosyncratic risk. Policy mixes affect saving incentives differently according to their effect on the liquidity premium- the return difference between less liquid assets and public debt. We derive an intuitive analytical expression linking the liquidity premium with consumption differentials amongst different types of agents. This underscores the presence of a transmission mechanism through which the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy shapes economic stability via its effect on the portfolio choice of private agents. We call it the self-insurance demand channel , which moves the liquidity premium in the opposite direction to the standard policy-driven supply channel . Our analysis thus reveals the presence of two competing forces driving the liquidity premium. We show that the relative strength of the two is tightly linked to the policy mix in place and the type of business cycle shock hitting the economy. This implies that to stabilize the economy, monetary policy should consider the impact of the self-insurance on the liquidity premium.\n\nKeywords: monetary-fiscal interaction, liquidity, government debt, HANK\n\nJEL Classification: E12, E52, E62, E58, E63.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the responses of fiscal and monetary policies to the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a convergence of their operational boundaries. This has revived the attention on the long-term implications for economic stability and policy effectiveness of the fiscal-monetary policy mix and poses new challenges for the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of substantial fiscal expansions.\n\nAt the same time, a burgeoning research agenda has highlighted the empirical differences in portfolios across the distribution of wealth and its relevance in terms of policy effectiveness and macroeconomic dynamics. In a seminal contribution, Kaplan et al. (2018) distinguish types of households by the prevalence of liquid or illiquid assets in their portfolios and describe the implications of different types of households for the transmission of monetary policy. Bayer et al. (2023) point to the importance of the liquidity channel of fiscal policy for its overall effect: the issuance of liquid government debt to finance discretionary government spending leads to a fall in the liquidity premium, defined as the return difference between less liquid assets and public debt. This, in turn, induces the households to save more in liquid assets that improve their ability to smooth consumption after negative shocks. We build on their work and analyze the transmission mechanism through which the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy shapes economic stability, i.e., via its effect on the portfolio choice of private agents. The purpose of this paper is to study how different combinations of active and passive policies affect the liquidity properties of the portfolios of different types of agents in the economy and what are the resulting challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nFor this, we use a New-Keynesian model with limited household heterogeneity in which three types of agents differ in their ability to trade in financial assets, in the spirit of Bilbiie (2024). The model features incomplete financial markets, on which agents can only trade liquid, nominal government bonds and an illiquid, real physical asset, i.e., capital. Our economy is made of capitalists , who can trade in both markets; savers , who can only adjust their liquid asset portfolio and cannot access the return from capital investments for consumption purposes; and hand-to-mouth\n\nhouseholds, who cannot engage in the purchase of any asset, therefore relying on their labor income and previously accumulated government bonds for their consumption. Households are subject to idiosyncratic shocks that make them switch types according to an exogenous transition probability. When moving across types, households may only carry with them their government bonds. This characteristic defines the liquidity of this asset, contrary to capital.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of a fiscal authority that chooses the quantity of nominal tax revenues in a model with idiosyncratic uncertainty serves the further purpose of extending the range of policy mixes that we can consider in our analysis. Hagedorn (2021) shows that the demand for nominal bonds in incomplete-market economies combined with a fiscal authority that targets a nominal quantity leads to price-level determinacy independently of any interest rate rule. In our setup, the fiscal authority chooses the quantity of nominal taxes, and determinacy is attained by allowing nominal debt to adjust automatically to ensure that the government budget constraint is satisfied for any price level. The central bank then sets freely the nominal interest rate that clears the bond market, with no need to respond to any endogenous variable. Hence, the price level can be uniquely determined, jointly by monetary and fiscal policy, even when the interest rate is exogenously chosen. 1 Hence, when fiscal policy is specified in nominal terms, shifts in the price level affect the real value of debt and thus affect real aggregate demand. 2 Crucially, this setup is different from the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level, which assumes that the government budget constraint must be satisfied by only one price level.\n\nThe first contribution of this paper is methodological. We extend the model of Bilbiie (2024) to a three-agent (or states) setting, with different liquidity across two assets that are traded and held in positive net supply in equilibrium, so there is some notion of a 'portfolio choice', but still in a tractable way. This extension is needed to capture the 'self-insurance' channel at the center of our analysis. This channel is present in quantitative HANK models like Bayer et al. (2023) and Auclert\n\net al. (2024). We show that a two-agent set up is not enough to capture it and that our analytically tractable three-ag\n######################\nOutput:",

To answer these questions, we build a heterogenous agents New Keynesian model where three different types of agents can save in assets with different liquidity profiles to insure against idiosyncratic risk. Policy mixes affect saving incentives differently according to their effect on the liquidity premium- the return difference between less liquid assets and public debt. We derive an intuitive analytical expression linking the liquidity premium with consumption differentials amongst different types of agents. This underscores the presence of a transmission mechanism through which the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy shapes economic stability via its effect on the portfolio choice of private agents. We call it the self-insurance demand channel , which moves the liquidity premium in the opposite direction to the standard policy-driven supply channel . Our analysis thus reveals the presence of two competing forces driving the liquidity premium. We show that the relative strength of the two is tightly linked to the policy mix in place and the type of business cycle shock hitting the economy. This implies that to stabilize the economy, monetary policy should consider the impact of the self-insurance on the liquidity premium.\n\nKeywords: monetary-fiscal interaction, liquidity, government debt, HANK\n\nJEL Classification: E12, E52, E62, E58, E63.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the responses of fiscal and monetary policies to the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a convergence of their operational boundaries. This has revived the attention on the long-term implications for economic stability and policy effectiveness of the fiscal-monetary policy mix and poses new challenges for the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of substantial fiscal expansions.\n\nAt the same time, a burgeoning research agenda has highlighted the empirical differences in portfolios across the distribution of wealth and its relevance in terms of policy effectiveness and macroeconomic dynamics. In a seminal contribution, Kaplan et al. (2018) distinguish types of households by the prevalence of liquid or illiquid assets in their portfolios and describe the implications of different types of households for the transmission of monetary policy. Bayer et al. (2023) point to the importance of the liquidity channel of fiscal policy for its overall effect: the issuance of liquid government debt to finance discretionary government spending leads to a fall in the liquidity premium, defined as the return difference between less liquid assets and public debt. This, in turn, induces the households to save more in liquid assets that improve their ability to smooth consumption after negative shocks. We build on their work and analyze the transmission mechanism through which the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy shapes economic stability, i.e., via its effect on the portfolio choice of private agents. The purpose of this paper is to study how different combinations of active and passive policies affect the liquidity properties of the portfolios of different types of agents in the economy and what are the resulting challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nFor this, we use a New-Keynesian model with limited household heterogeneity in which three types of agents differ in their ability to trade in financial assets, in the spirit of Bilbiie (2024). The model features incomplete financial markets, on which agents can only trade liquid, nominal government bonds and an illiquid, real physical asset, i.e., capital. Our economy is made of capitalists , who can trade in both markets; savers , who can only adjust their liquid asset portfolio and cannot access the return from capital investments for consumption purposes; and hand-to-mouth\n\nhouseholds, who cannot engage in the purchase of any asset, therefore relying on their labor income and previously accumulated government bonds for their consumption. Households are subject to idiosyncratic shocks that make them switch types according to an exogenous transition probability. When moving across types, households may only carry with them their government bonds. This characteristic defines the liquidity of this asset, contrary to capital.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of a fiscal authority that chooses the quantity of nominal tax revenues in a model with idiosyncratic uncertainty serves the further purpose of extending the range of policy mixes that we can consider in our analysis. Hagedorn (2021) shows that the demand for nominal bonds in incomplete-market economies combined with a fiscal authority that targets a nominal quantity leads to price-level determinacy independently of any interest rate rule. In our setup, the fiscal authority chooses the quantity of nominal taxes, and determinacy is attained by allowing nominal debt to adjust automatically to ensure that the government budget constraint is satisfied for any price level. The central bank then sets freely the nominal interest rate that clears the bond market, with no need to respond to any endogenous variable. Hence, the price level can be uniquely determined, jointly by monetary and fiscal policy, even when the interest rate is exogenously chosen. 1 Hence, when fiscal policy is specified in nominal terms, shifts in the price level affect the real value of debt and thus affect real aggregate demand. 2 Crucially, this setup is different from the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level, which assumes that the government budget constraint must be satisfied by only one price level.\n\nThe first contribution of this paper is methodological. We extend the model of Bilbiie (2024) to a three-agent (or states) setting, with different liquidity across two assets that are traded and held in positive net supply in equilibrium, so there is some notion of a 'portfolio choice', but still in a tractable way. This extension is needed to capture the 'self-insurance' channel at the center of our analysis. This channel is present in quantitative HANK models like Bayer et al. (2023) and Auclert\n\net al. (2024). We show that a two-agent set up is not enough to capture it and that our analytically tractable three-ag"

        "text": "� 𝑗 𝑡 hours of work, 𝐾 𝐾 𝑡 is capitalists capital stock, 𝐼 𝐾 𝑡 is investment in capital, 𝑊 𝑡 nominal wages, 𝑅 𝑏 𝑡 the risk free net nominal interest rate on bonds, 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 the gross real rental rate of capital, 𝐷 𝑡 are economy-wide firms profits, 𝑇 𝑗 𝑡 are lump sum taxes, 𝜏 𝑗 are steady state transfers to equate agents consumption, 𝜎 the inverse of the intertermporal elasticity of substitution, 𝜑 the inverse of the Frish elasticity, 𝜓 the disutility weight of labor and 𝛿 is capital depreciation.\n\nWe assume equal redistribution of the total tax revenue needed by the government. Note that although type-H agents cannot trade in bonds, there will be a certain stock of this asset on the island as agents can carry these with them across type switches.\n\nWe also assume that capital investment is subject to a convex adjustment cost 𝜄 so that capital accumulation reads:\n\n𝐾 𝐾 𝑡 = 𝐼 𝐾 𝑡 ' › 1 -𝜄 𝐼 𝐾 𝑡 𝐼 𝐾 𝑡 -1 -1 ! 2 ' fi + 𝐾 𝐾 𝑡 -1 ( 1 -𝛿 ) . (10)\n\n«\n\n‹\n\nSince one of our focuses is fiscal policy, we introduce this adjustment cost to obtain fiscal multipliers in line with what is found in the literature, e.g., (Cantore and Freund, 2021; Hagedorn et al. , 2019), under the active monetary policy regime, thereby making our analysis more realistic.\n\n2.2 Firms\n\nSince our model enriches the household side of the economy, we model firms according to a standard New Keynesian model with Rotemberg (1982) adjustment costs. A continuum of monopolistically competitive firms indexed by 𝑖 ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] produce differentiated intermediate goods 𝑌 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) using labor 𝑁 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) and capital 𝐾 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) according to the following production function:\n\n𝐹 ( 𝐴 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 , 𝐾 𝑡 ) = ( 𝐴 𝑡 𝑁 𝑡 ( 𝑖 )) 1 -𝛼 𝐾 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) 𝛼 , (11)\n\nwhere 𝐴 𝑡 is an AR(1) technology shock and 𝛼 is the capital share of income. Firms seek to maximize their profits by optimally choosing their prices 𝑃 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) subject to the demand they face and price adjustment costs. The firm's problem is represented by the following dynamic optimization problem:\n\nmax { 𝑃 𝑡 ( 𝑖 )} 𝐸 0 ∞ ∑︁ 𝑡 = 0 Ψ 𝐾 0 ,𝑡 GLYPH<2> 𝑃 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑌 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) -𝑊 𝑡 𝑁 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) -𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 𝐾 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) -𝐴𝐶 𝑡 GLYPH<3> s.t. 𝑌 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) = GLYPH<18> 𝑃 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑃 𝑡 GLYPH<19> -𝜖 𝑌 𝑡 , 𝑌 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) = ( 𝐴 𝑡 𝑁 𝑡 ( 𝑖 )) 1 -𝛼 + 𝐾 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) 𝛼 -𝐹,\n\nwhere Ψ 𝐾 0 ,𝑡 = 𝛽 𝑡 GLYPH<16> 𝐶 𝐾 𝑡 𝐶 𝐾 0 GLYPH<17> -𝜎 is the marginal rate of intertemporal substitution of capitalists, 𝜖 > 1 is the elasticity of substitution between different varieties of goods and 𝐹 are fixed costs in production to ensure 0 profits in steady state. We specify Rotemberg adjustment costs 𝐴𝐶 𝑡 according to the standard quadratic representation:\n\n𝐴𝐶 𝑡 = 𝜉 2 GLYPH<18> 𝑃 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑃 𝑡 -1 ( 𝑖 ) -1 GLYPH<19> 2 𝑌 𝑡 ,\n\nwhere 𝜉 is a positive parameter that dictates the cost of adjusting prices.\n\nBy optimizing this symmetric problem, the firms set the price to equate the real marginal cost ( 𝑀𝐶 𝑡 ) to a markup over price, subject to adjustment costs. The first-order conditions for this problem generate the New Keynesian Phillips curve, providing the connection between inflation and output:\n\n( 1 -𝜖 ) + 𝜖 𝑀𝐶 𝑡 -Π 𝑡 𝜉 ( Π 𝑡 -1 ) + 𝛽 Ψ 𝐾 𝑡,𝑡 + 1 Π �"

The rule is intended to reduce the diversion of ICs to unauthorized end uses or end users that meet the control parameters of ECCN 3A090 by end users who misrepresent the performance capabilities of their ICs to the foundries that manufacture them or the companies that assemble the ICs, or OSATs, into packages. The rule requires additional diligence for foundries  and  OSATs  to  verify  technical  parameters,  although  approved  IC  designers  are  considered  a  reliable  source  to  verify  technical parameters of the applicable advanced logic ICs. NVIDIA Corporation is an approved IC designer and thus the rule is not expected to have an impact on our operations or on product sales to China.\n\nCertain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K including statements regarding the scope of the licensing requirement under the IFR; NVIDIA's products that are subject to the IFR; the impact of the IFR on NVIDIA's future products; the effectiveness and effective date of the IFR; NVIDIA providing feedback on the IFR during the notice and comment period; and the 'Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits' rule unexpected to have an impact on NVIDIA's operations or on product sales to China are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; NVIDIA's reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test NVIDIA's products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to NVIDIA's existing product and technologies; market acceptance of NVIDIA's products or its partners' products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of NVIDIA's products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the most recent reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

The rule is intended to reduce the diversion of ICs to unauthorized end uses or end users that meet the control parameters of ECCN 3A090 by end users who misrepresent the performance capabilities of their ICs to the foundries that manufacture them or the companies that assemble the ICs, or OSATs, into packages. The rule requires additional diligence for foundries  and  OSATs  to  verify  technical  parameters,  although  approved  IC  designers  are  considered  a  reliable  source  to  verify  technical parameters of the applicable advanced logic ICs. NVIDIA Corporation is an approved IC designer and thus the rule is not expected to have an impact on our operations or on product sales to China.\n\nCertain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K including statements regarding the scope of the licensing requirement under the IFR; NVIDIA's products that are subject to the IFR; the impact of the IFR on NVIDIA's future products; the effectiveness and effective date of the IFR; NVIDIA providing feedback on the IFR during the notice and comment period; and the 'Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits' rule unexpected to have an impact on NVIDIA's operations or on product sales to China are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; NVIDIA's reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test NVIDIA's products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to NVIDIA's existing product and technologies; market acceptance of NVIDIA's products or its partners' products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of NVIDIA's products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the most recent reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Such person shall be chairperson of the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the right and authority to convene and, for any or no reason, to recess and/or to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as in his or her judgment are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.

Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.\n\nSection 5.2    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

Each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, legislative or any other type whatsoever (a ' Proceeding '), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while serving as a director or officer of  the  Corporation,  is  or  was  serving  at  the  request  of  the  Corporation  as  a  director,  officer,  employee,  agent  or  trustee  of  another  corporation,  or  of  a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (for purposes of this Article VI, an ' Indemnitee '), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise  taxes  and  penalties  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement)  reasonably  incurred  or  suffered  by  such  Indemnitee  in  connection  therewith,  provided  such Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with  respect  to  any  criminal  action  or  Proceeding,  had  no  reasonable  cause  to  believe  the  Indemnitee's  conduct  was  unlawful.  Such  indemnification  shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnitees' heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section 6.5, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article VI to indemnify any Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the first instance by the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall indemnify such Indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.\n\nSection 6.2    Advance of Expenses. The Corporation shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by such an Indemnitee in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however , that the payment of such expenses incurred by such an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.\n\nSection 6.3    Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion but subject to applicable law,\n######################\nOutput:",

Each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, legislative or any other type whatsoever (a ' Proceeding '), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while serving as a director or officer of  the  Corporation,  is  or  was  serving  at  the  request  of  the  Corporation  as  a  director,  officer,  employee,  agent  or  trustee  of  another  corporation,  or  of  a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (for purposes of this Article VI, an ' Indemnitee '), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise  taxes  and  penalties  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement)  reasonably  incurred  or  suffered  by  such  Indemnitee  in  connection  therewith,  provided  such Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with  respect  to  any  criminal  action  or  Proceeding,  had  no  reasonable  cause  to  believe  the  Indemnitee's  conduct  was  unlawful.  Such  indemnification  shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnitees' heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section 6.5, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article VI to indemnify any Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the first instance by the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall indemnify such Indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.\n\nSection 6.2    Advance of Expenses. The Corporation shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by such an Indemnitee in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however , that the payment of such expenses incurred by such an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.\n\nSection 6.3    Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion but subject to applicable law,"

The rights conferred on any person in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion but subject to applicable law,  to  provide  rights  to  indemnification  or  advancement  of  expenses  to  any  person  other  than  an  Indemnified  Person  or  to  provide  greater  rights  to indemnification and advancement of expenses than those provided in this Article VI to any Indemnified Person.\n\nSection 6.4    Indemnification Agreements. The Board is authorized to cause the Corporation to enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, trustee, partner or managing member of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing indemnification or advancement rights to such person. Such rights may be greater than those provided in this Article VI.\n\nSection 6.5    Claims .\n\n6.5.1    Right to Bring Suit. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such Proceeding) under Section 6.1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or a claim for advancement of expenses is not  paid  in  full  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  Corporation  has  received  a  statement  or  statements  therefor,  the  Indemnitee  shall  be  entitled  at  any  time thereafter (but not before) to bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for entitlement to indemnification under applicable law.\n\n6.5.2    Effect of Determination.

In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking provided hereunder, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or is required to repay any amounts advanced pursuant to the terms of such undertaking, under this Article VI shall be on the Corporation.\n\nSection 6.6    Nature of Rights. The rights conferred upon Indemnitees in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.

The rights conferred on any person in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion but subject to applicable law,  to  provide  rights  to  indemnification  or  advancement  of  expenses  to  any  person  other  than  an  Indemnified  Person  or  to  provide  greater  rights  to indemnification and advancement of expenses than those provided in this Article VI to any Indemnified Person.\n\nSection 6.4    Indemnification Agreements. The Board is authorized to cause the Corporation to enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, trustee, partner or managing member of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing indemnification or advancement rights to such person. Such rights may be greater than those provided in this Article VI.\n\nSection 6.5    Claims .\n\n6.5.1    Right to Bring Suit. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such Proceeding) under Section 6.1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or a claim for advancement of expenses is not  paid  in  full  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  Corporation  has  received  a  statement  or  statements  therefor,  the  Indemnitee  shall  be  entitled  at  any  time thereafter (but not before) to bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for entitlement to indemnification under applicable law.\n\n6.5.2    Effect of Determination. Neither the failure of the Corporation (whether by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of a suit by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct to be entitled to indemnification under applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (whether by its directors who are not parties to such action, a  committee  of  such  directors,  independent  legal  counsel  or  its  stockholders)  that  the  Indemnitee  has  not  met  such  standard  of  conduct,  shall  create  a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.\n\n6.5.3    Burden of Proof. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking provided hereunder, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or is required to repay any amounts advanced pursuant to the terms of such undertaking, under this Article VI shall be on the Corporation.\n\nSection 6.6    Nature of Rights. The rights conferred upon Indemnitees in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under this Article VI shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to  these  Bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the Proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought.\n\nSection 6.7    Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, trustee, partner or managing member of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have"

Introduction\n\nIn the last 3 decades, rapid global climate change necessitates a global transition to environmentally  sustainable  energy  sources,  thereby  contributing  to  reducing  carbon emissions. Utilizing renewable energy sources has the potential to decrease global carbon emissions.  Several  long-term  policy  instruments  are  crucial  for  promoting  synergy  with renewable energy sources to attain sustained long-term growth (Obekpa and Alola, 2023; Yue et al., 2022). There is a growing agreement that cleaner economic productivity may be achieved through energy efficiency and the effective use of energy forms; this propels the global  ambition  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  Over  the  next  five  years,  the International Energy Agency (2021) forecasts significant growth in nuclear energy usage, notwithstanding  ongoing  discussions  about  its  designation  as  a  green  investment (International Energy Agency, 2021). Addressing climate change is inherently connected to advancing cost-effective, low-carbon energy technologies that can be implemented globally. Implementing a technology involves and interacts with numerous mechanisms, including economies of scale, research and development, and organizational learning, all of which can contribute to reducing technology costs. Reduced costs create new deployment opportunities,\n\nresulting in a beneficial feedback loop or multiplier effect (Jessika Trancik et al., 2015). Nuclear energy is a prime example of this process among low-carbon electricity technologies.\n\nScholars and policy analysts have taken an interest in nuclear energy, considering these  developments.  There  is  an  opportunity  for  global  energy  systems  to  reduce  their environmental  impact  by  using  low-carbon  energy  sources  and  technology.  Despite environmentalists' longstanding opposition, some have suggested reviewing nuclear energy as a clean option to fight global warming (Hassan et al., 2023, 2022). Many clean energy sources  can  now  be  used  due  to  technological  advances  and  lower  costs,  despite transportation  costs,  growing  commodity  prices,  and  supply  chain  issues.  Despite  their popularity, renewable energy sources are being promoted to alleviate the climate catastrophe and boost economic growth. To accelerate energy innovation for decarbonization, public investment in research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) (Meckling et al., 2022; Simionescu,  2023).  The  budget  allocation  for  research  and  development  (R&D) in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and nuclear energy is critical for achieving sustainable development goals 7, 9, and 13. This will accelerate progress in energy innovation, support the shift to cleaner energy sources, and assist in mitigating climate change (Jin et al., 2023a). Sustainable development cannot be achieved without addressing the energy sector, which must simultaneously reduce harmful emissions while increasing access to energy for more individuals.  There are risks associated with every technology that might affect people and the planet. Although low-carbon energy sources do not emit carbon dioxide when they are in  use,  they  do  produce  emissions  and  trash  throughout  their  lifecycle,  from  building  to production  to  decommissioning.  Therefore,  it  is  critical  to  compare  potential  energy technologies  to  determine  how  well  they  mesh  with  sustainable  development  objectives\n\n(World Nuclear Association, 2014). The potential impact of energy sector R&D is becoming more  recognized  considering  rising  worries  about  climate  change  and  global  warming. Government  support  for  energy  sector  R&D  is  critical  for  the  discovery  of  low-carbon technology that can maintain a steady supply of energy, lessen reliance on fossil fuels, and mitigate the financial burden of growing nonrenewable energy prices (Danish and Ulucak, 2022\n######################\nOutput:",

Government  support  for  energy  sector  R&D  is  critical  for  the  discovery  of  low-carbon technology that can maintain a steady supply of energy, lessen reliance on fossil fuels, and mitigate the financial burden of growing nonrenewable energy prices (Danish and Ulucak, 2022).\n\nArtificial  intelligence  (AI)  is  a  pivotal  force  driving  industrial  and  technical innovation,  significantly  impacting  advancements  in  energy  conservation  and  reducing carbon emissions. Enhanced comprehension of the impact of AI on energy transition and carbon emissions may facilitate its application in achieving carbon neutrality (Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Energy production is only one of several industries that brought about a new digital age thanks to technological advancements. Rapid utilization of nuclear energy is essential to meet the decarbonization targets set for 2050. When licensing nuclear technology for commercialization, digital replicas make nuclear reactor commissioning and full-cycle operation easier. Finding ways to use fewer computing resources is necessary to industrialize  nuclear  energy  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (GHGE).  New  digital technologies are opening up exciting possibilities for practically bringing theory and practice together. Innovative technology has reached the industrial level rapidly due to the energy transition. Various technologies, including AI, are part of the nuclear sector. A regulatory framework for the age of digitization can only be established by first identifying the relevant variables. New nuclear technology capabilities will be able to flourish in the future thanks to this framework (Renteria del Toro et al., 2024).\n\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation remain critical to achieving sustainable development while reducing climate vulnerability, particularly among climate-exposed and sensitive  regions.  Yet,  achieving  a  balance  between  climate-resilience  pathways,  high economic productivity, high human development, and energy efficiency appears complex, leading to potential trade-offs (Sarkodie et al., 2023). Against the backdrop and driven by the new possibilities for cleaner manufacturing with AI, this study focuses on how AI and nuclear  energy  technologies  influence  environmental  performance.  Strict  environmental restrictions  and  sustainable  nuclear  energy  generation  could  be  crucial  in  achieving sustainable development, which aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social well-being while ensuring a sustainable future.  This study seeks to address several questions based on the discussion. Firstly, does integrating artificial intelligence with nuclear energy technology contribute to reducing carbon emissions? Secondly, can incorporating artificial intelligence into the nuclear energy technology sector assist in managing carbon emissions? In this paper, we expand the nuclear energy and pollution model by introducing nuclear energy technology and artificial intelligence to evaluate the moderating role of AI in the relationship between NETB and CO 2 emissions.\n\nThis  study  contributes  significantly  to  the  existing  literature.  (i)  This  piece  of research work examines the impact of AI and nuclear energy technology on pollution levels in selected OECD countries. This research uses a panel data methodology to elucidate the pollution levels in OECD countries that consume nuclear energy from 1994 to 2020. (ii) The study introduces the interaction effect between AI and nuclear energy technology budgeting to  examine AI's  moderating  role  in  the  relationship  between  nuclear  energy  technology budgeting  and  CO 2 emissions.  The  moderating  role  is  essential  for  optimizing  the\n\ndeployment and utilization of nuclear energy, as AI-driven strategies can enhance the lowcarbon  advantages  of  nuclear  energy.  (iii)  This  study  employs  the  Method  of  Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) for empirical estimation. MM-QR utilizes the method of moments to develop more robust estimators compared to traditional quantile  regression, facilitating enhanced inference in complex, non-linear data structures where ordinary least squares  (OLS)  methods  may  be  inadequate.  MM-QR  contributes  methodologically  by offering  quantile-specific  insights  while  addressing  endogeneity  and  heteroscedasticity, thereby enhancing the understanding of relationships within complex data structures. This tool is essential in empirical research, especially in disciplines where it is crucial to capture distributional heterogeneity and address complex data challenges.\n\nThe article organizes the remainder of the section: Section 2 provides information about  the  profile  of  sample  countries. Afterward,  use the  econometric  tools  and  data  in Section 3, then explain and evaluate the empirical findings in Section 3.  In the last section, the paper presents its findings.\n\n2. The Profile of Sampled OECD Countries\n\nFrom 1990 to around 2010, coal and other fossil fuels played a significant role in the continuous emissions rise. However, global CO 2 emissions have stabilized over the past decade  due  to  improved  energy  efficiency  and  the  increasing  use  of  renewable  energy sources. This trend is especially evident in the United States and the European Union. The COVID-19  epidemic  caused  a  short-lived  decrease  in  emissions  in  2020,  but  when economies resumed in 2021, they quickly recovered, highlighting the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels in numerous regions worldwide (Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, 2020). In 2022,  OECD  nations  substantially  contributed  to  global  CO₂  emissions,  mainly  from energy-related sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "The potential impact of energy sector R&D is becoming more  recognized  considering  rising  worries  about  climate  change  and  global  warming. Government  support  for  energy  sector  R&D  is  critical  for  the  discovery  of  low-carbon technology that can maintain a steady supply of energy, lessen reliance on fossil fuels, and mitigate the financial burden of growing nonrenewable energy prices (Danish and Ulucak, 2022).\n\nArtificial  intelligence  (AI)  is  a  pivotal  force  driving  industrial  and  technical innovation,  significantly  impacting  advancements  in  energy  conservation  and  reducing carbon emissions. Enhanced comprehension of the impact of AI on energy transition and carbon emissions may facilitate its application in achieving carbon neutrality (Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Energy production is only one of several industries that brought about a new digital age thanks to technological advancements. Rapid utilization of nuclear energy is essential to meet the decarbonization targets set for 2050. When licensing nuclear technology for commercialization, digital replicas make nuclear reactor commissioning and full-cycle operation easier. Finding ways to use fewer computing resources is necessary to industrialize  nuclear  energy  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (GHGE).  New  digital technologies are opening up exciting possibilities for practically bringing theory and practice together. Innovative technology has reached the industrial level rapidly due to the energy transition. Various technologies, including AI, are part of the nuclear sector. A regulatory framework for the age of digitization can only be established by first identifying the relevant variables. New nuclear technology capabilities will be able to flourish in the future thanks to this framework (Renteria del Toro et al., 2024).\n\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation remain critical to achieving sustainable development while reducing climate vulnerability, particularly among climate-exposed and sensitive  regions.  Yet,  achieving  a  balance  between  climate-resilience  pathways,  high economic productivity, high human development, and energy efficiency appears complex, leading to potential trade-offs (Sarkodie et al., 2023). Against the backdrop and driven by the new possibilities for cleaner manufacturing with AI, this study focuses on how AI and nuclear  energy  technologies  influence  environmental  performance.  Strict  environmental restrictions  and  sustainable  nuclear  energy  generation  could  be  crucial  in  achieving sustainable development, which aims to balance economic growth, environmental protection, and social well-being while ensuring a sustainable future.  This study seeks to address several questions based on the discussion. Firstly, does integrating artificial intelligence with nuclear energy technology contribute to reducing carbon emissions? Secondly, can incorporating artificial intelligence into the nuclear energy technology sector assist in managing carbon emissions? In this paper, we expand the nuclear energy and pollution model by introducing nuclear energy technology and artificial intelligence to evaluate the moderating role of AI in the relationship between NETB and CO 2 emissions.\n\nThis  study  contributes  significantly  to  the  existing  literature.  (i)  This  piece  of research work examines the impact of AI and nuclear energy technology on pollution levels in selected OECD countries. This research uses a panel data methodology to elucidate the pollution levels in OECD countries that consume nuclear energy from 1994 to 2020. (ii) The study introduces the interaction effect between AI and nuclear energy technology budgeting to  examine AI's  moderating  role  in  the  relationship  between  nuclear  energy  technology budgeting  and  CO 2 emissions.  The  moderating  role  is  essential  for  optimizing  the\n\ndeployment and utilization of nuclear energy, as AI-driven strategies can enhance the lowcarbon  advantages  of  nuclear  energy.  (iii)  This  study  employs  the  Method  of  Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) for empirical estimation. MM-QR utilizes the method of moments to develop more robust estimators compared to traditional quantile  regression, facilitating enhanced inference in complex, non-linear data structures where ordinary least squares  (OLS)  methods  may  be  inadequate.  MM-QR  contributes  methodologically  by offering  quantile-specific  insights  while  addressing  endogeneity  and  heteroscedasticity, thereby enhancing the understanding of relationships within complex data structures. This tool is essential in empirical research, especially in disciplines where it is crucial to capture distributional heterogeneity and address complex data challenges.\n\nThe article organizes the remainder of the section: Section 2 provides information about  the  profile  of  sample  countries. Afterward,  use the  econometric  tools  and  data  in Section 3, then explain and evaluate the empirical findings in Section 3.  In the last section, the paper presents its findings.\n\n2. The Profile of Sampled OECD Countries\n\nFrom 1990 to around 2010, coal and other fossil fuels played a significant role in the continuous emissions rise. However, global CO 2 emissions have stabilized over the past decade  due  to  improved  energy  efficiency  and  the  increasing  use  of  renewable  energy sources. This trend is especially evident in the United States and the European Union. The COVID-19  epidemic  caused  a  short-lived  decrease  in  emissions  in  2020,  but  when economies resumed in 2021, they quickly recovered, highlighting the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels in numerous regions worldwide (Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, 2020). In 2022,  OECD  nations  substantially  contributed  to  global  CO₂  emissions,  mainly  from energy-related sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas"

In 2022,  OECD  nations  substantially  contributed  to  global  CO₂  emissions,  mainly  from energy-related sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Global emissions from the energy sector have continued to rise, particularly due to coal-fired electricity generation. Despite certain  regions  achieving  progress  in  emissions  reductions  via  the  implementation  of renewable energy, global emissions have nonetheless surged to an unprecedented level, exceeding 36.8 billion metric tons. Countries within the OECD, especially in Europe and North America, experienced diverse trends. Conversely, the United States experienced a modest rise in emissions attributed to increased demand in the building sector during severe weather events, despite the growth of clean energy sources such as wind and solar (IEA, 2022). Figure 1 shows annual per capita CO 2 emissions worldwide in 2024.\n\n======= INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE ========\n\nThe utilization of nuclear energy has shown a consistent upward trend since the early 1960s. With a 300-gigawatt electrical (GWe) capacity, nuclear energy currently contributes 25% to the OECD countries' electricity consumption. It is crucial for maintaining the energy security of the OECD. Nuclear energy constitutes the most significant proportion of clean energy production among OECD countries. The Paris Agreement of 2015, according to the OECD database, seeks to restrict global warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels; projections indicate a rise of 3-6 degrees Celsius in the global average temperature by the century's end. Nuclear power plants, expected to supply low-carbon electricity to many countries for the forthcoming decades, will experience significant disruptions in their operations  (Nuclear  Energy  Agency,  2022).  As  significant  economies  and  notable greenhouse gas emitters, the OECD countries bear a considerable responsibility by investing significantly in energy innovation via research and development (R&D). This study seeks to investigate and propose effective policy measures concerning the role of R&D in the nuclear energy sector to mitigate pollution.\n\nApplications aimed at boosting workplace productivity, particularly in the finance and manufacturing sectors, drove notable growth in the adoption of AI in OECD countries in 2022. A significant number of companies have implemented AI technologies for various functions,  including  production  tracking,  image  recognition,  and  natural  language processing; however, the extent of adoption has shown considerable variation. Large firms typically spearhead AI integration, particularly for tasks aimed at optimizing operations and enhancing output quality. Nonetheless, the general adoption rate stayed comparatively low, influenced  in  part  by  the  expenses  linked  to  AI  implementation  and  the  insufficient availability of skilled personnel required for its effective operation (Stijn, 2023). The trend\n\nfor the number of artificial intelligence-related patents in OECD countries comparing the data of 1995 and 2020 is shown in Figure 2.\n\n======= INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE =======\n\n======= INSERT TABLE 1 HERE ========\n\n3. Theoretical background and literature review\n\n3.1. Theoretical background\n\nFollowing  Fatouros  and  Stengos,  (2023),  this  study  within  the  framework  of  an endogenous growth model with environmental constraints and vertical innovations derives optimal  nuclear  energy  technology.  Innovation  in  this  study  is  directed  to  nuclear technologies and artificial intelligence.\n\nSeveral fundamental theoretical frameworks inform policy, technological advancement,  and  strategic  planning  for  achieving  net-zero  carbon  emissions.  These frameworks  primarily  focus  on  integrating  nuclear  energy  technology  and  artificial intelligence (AI). The theory of technological innovation underpins this study, emphasizing the  role  of  technological  advancements  in  facilitating  societal  progress  and  addressing significant issues such as carbon emissions.  Key concepts like the diffusion of innovation illustrate the impact of technologies like nuclear energy and AI on various industries and society.  Innovations in nuclear energy technology-such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactor designs-present opportunities for improved safety and cost efficiency in the context of achieving net-zero emissions. Meanwhile, AI enhances the optimization of\n\nreactor  operations,  predictive  maintenance,  and  safety  monitoring.  The  combination  of advancements in nuclear technology and AI-driven management significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of nuclear energy as a low-emission power source.\n\nEnergy  transition  models  analyze  historical  trends,  transformation  obstacles,  and elements promoting the transition to sustainable energy. Nuclear energy provides consistent baseline power, which can support the intermittent nature of renewable sources. Additionally, AI  enhances  energy  management  and  grid  reliability,  facilitating  a  smoother  transition. Policies must promote their adoption, ensure safe operation, and facilitate integration with other  low-carbon  technologies  by  enabling  nuclear  energy  and AI  to  substantially  aid  in achieving net-zero objectives. Environmental economics shapes the design of incentives and penalties,  ensuring  the  economic  viability  and  competitiveness  of  nuclear  and AI-driven systems within the energy market.\n\n3.2. Literature Review\n\nThis  outline  presents  a  well-organized  framework  for  examining  the  effects  of nuclear energy and AI on emissions reduction, emphasizing diverse viewpoints found in the existing  literature.  Nuclear  energy  is  a  reliable  low-carbon  power  source  for  mitigating global  CO\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "epidemic  caused  a  short-lived  decrease  in  emissions  in  2020,  but  when economies resumed in 2021, they quickly recovered, highlighting the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels in numerous regions worldwide (Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, 2020). In 2022,  OECD  nations  substantially  contributed  to  global  CO₂  emissions,  mainly  from energy-related sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Global emissions from the energy sector have continued to rise, particularly due to coal-fired electricity generation. Despite certain  regions  achieving  progress  in  emissions  reductions  via  the  implementation  of renewable energy, global emissions have nonetheless surged to an unprecedented level, exceeding 36.8 billion metric tons. Countries within the OECD, especially in Europe and North America, experienced diverse trends. Conversely, the United States experienced a modest rise in emissions attributed to increased demand in the building sector during severe weather events, despite the growth of clean energy sources such as wind and solar (IEA, 2022). Figure 1 shows annual per capita CO 2 emissions worldwide in 2024.\n\n======= INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE ========\n\nThe utilization of nuclear energy has shown a consistent upward trend since the early 1960s. With a 300-gigawatt electrical (GWe) capacity, nuclear energy currently contributes 25% to the OECD countries' electricity consumption. It is crucial for maintaining the energy security of the OECD. Nuclear energy constitutes the most significant proportion of clean energy production among OECD countries. The Paris Agreement of 2015, according to the OECD database, seeks to restrict global warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels; projections indicate a rise of 3-6 degrees Celsius in the global average temperature by the century's end. Nuclear power plants, expected to supply low-carbon electricity to many countries for the forthcoming decades, will experience significant disruptions in their operations  (Nuclear  Energy  Agency,  2022).  As  significant  economies  and  notable greenhouse gas emitters, the OECD countries bear a considerable responsibility by investing significantly in energy innovation via research and development (R&D). This study seeks to investigate and propose effective policy measures concerning the role of R&D in the nuclear energy sector to mitigate pollution.\n\nApplications aimed at boosting workplace productivity, particularly in the finance and manufacturing sectors, drove notable growth in the adoption of AI in OECD countries in 2022. A significant number of companies have implemented AI technologies for various functions,  including  production  tracking,  image  recognition,  and  natural  language processing; however, the extent of adoption has shown considerable variation. Large firms typically spearhead AI integration, particularly for tasks aimed at optimizing operations and enhancing output quality. Nonetheless, the general adoption rate stayed comparatively low, influenced  in  part  by  the  expenses  linked  to  AI  implementation  and  the  insufficient availability of skilled personnel required for its effective operation (Stijn, 2023). The trend\n\nfor the number of artificial intelligence-related patents in OECD countries comparing the data of 1995 and 2020 is shown in Figure 2.\n\n======= INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE =======\n\n======= INSERT TABLE 1 HERE ========\n\n3. Theoretical background and literature review\n\n3.1. Theoretical background\n\nFollowing  Fatouros  and  Stengos,  (2023),  this  study  within  the  framework  of  an endogenous growth model with environmental constraints and vertical innovations derives optimal  nuclear  energy  technology.  Innovation  in  this  study  is  directed  to  nuclear technologies and artificial intelligence.\n\nSeveral fundamental theoretical frameworks inform policy, technological advancement,  and  strategic  planning  for  achieving  net-zero  carbon  emissions.  These frameworks  primarily  focus  on  integrating  nuclear  energy  technology  and  artificial intelligence (AI). The theory of technological innovation underpins this study, emphasizing the  role  of  technological  advancements  in  facilitating  societal  progress  and  addressing significant issues such as carbon emissions.  Key concepts like the diffusion of innovation illustrate the impact of technologies like nuclear energy and AI on various industries and society.  Innovations in nuclear energy technology-such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactor designs-present opportunities for improved safety and cost efficiency in the context of achieving net-zero emissions. Meanwhile, AI enhances the optimization of\n\nreactor  operations,  predictive  maintenance,  and  safety  monitoring.  The  combination  of advancements in nuclear technology and AI-driven management significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of nuclear energy as a low-emission power source.\n\nEnergy  transition  models  analyze  historical  trends,  transformation  obstacles,  and elements promoting the transition to sustainable energy. Nuclear energy provides consistent baseline power, which can support the intermittent nature of renewable sources. Additionally, AI  enhances  energy  management  and  grid  reliability,  facilitating  a  smoother  transition. Policies must promote their adoption, ensure safe operation, and facilitate integration with other  low-carbon  technologies  by  enabling  nuclear  energy  and AI  to  substantially  aid  in achieving net-zero objectives. Environmental economics shapes the design of incentives and penalties,  ensuring  the  economic  viability  and  competitiveness  of  nuclear  and AI-driven systems within the energy market.\n\n3.2. Literature Review\n\nThis  outline  presents  a  well-organized  framework  for  examining  the  effects  of nuclear energy and AI on emissions reduction, emphasizing diverse viewpoints found in the existing  literature.  Nuclear  energy  is  a  reliable  low-carbon  power  source  for  mitigating global  CO"

Literature Review\n\nThis  outline  presents  a  well-organized  framework  for  examining  the  effects  of nuclear energy and AI on emissions reduction, emphasizing diverse viewpoints found in the existing  literature.  Nuclear  energy  is  a  reliable  low-carbon  power  source  for  mitigating global  CO 2 emissions.  Previous  studies  examined  the  relationship  between  sufficient investment in nuclear energy infrastructure, research, and development and decreased CO 2 emissions.  The  literature  on  nuclear  energy  technology  and  CO₂  emissions  emphasizes nuclear power's role as a low-carbon energy source that supports the transition to sustainable energy systems. Studies underscore the importance of energy technology innovation and effective policy in achieving emissions reductions and advancing nuclear energy. Jordaan et\n\nal., (2017a) highlighted Canada's uneven investment between fossil fuels and clean energy technologies, urging better alignment of federal and regional policies and enhanced financial access for clean energy projects to drive innovation and emissions reductions. This reflects a broader trend across the OECD and other developed nations, where policy plays a critical role in promoting or hindering clean energy investment (Alvarez-herranz et al., 2017; Danish and Ulucak, 2021).\n\nVarious studies showed that advancements in energy technologies, such as nuclear, play  a  crucial  role  in  decreasing  pollution.  For  instance,  Álvarez-herránz  et  al.,  (2017) discovered  that  prompt  innovation  in  the  energy  sector  improves  environmental  quality.

In  the  absence  of  sufficient  policy  backing,  the  potential  environmental  advantages  of nuclear and other low-carbon technologies might remain unfulfilled (Wang and Zhu, 2020). In summary, the existing literature consistently highlights the potential of nuclear energy to reduce CO 2 emissions, particularly when bolstered by focused policy, sufficient investment in research and development, and harmonious integration with renewable energy sources.\n\n4.

In doing so, we built upon the burgeoning research agenda, focusing on the empirical differences in portfolios across the wealth distribution and its impact on policy effectiveness and macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nUtilizing a New-Keynesian model with limited household heterogeneity, we considered the transmission mechanism arising from the demand side of assets that we label the 'self-insurance' channel. Through this channel, monetary and fiscal policy interact with the portfolio choices of private agents. This analysis revealed that the 'self-insurance' channel operates opposite to the standard one coming from the 'supply' of public debt, driving the liquidity premium. The presence of these two competing forces determines the behavior of the liquidity premium under different monetary and fiscal policy regimes. It shapes the relationship between this premium and the portfolio choices of households.\n\nOur first experiment illustrated how these channels manifest and interact in response to a standard technology shock. We found that when there is a large change in government debt, the supply channel enhances the gap in the liquidity premium. On the contrary, in regimes where changes in government debt are more tempered, the 'self-insurance' mechanism dominates. Moreover, our model suggested that the 'insurance-through-investment' motive is weak due to the poor complementarity between the two productive assets, indicating that the building of more capital stock, via its general equilibrium effect on labor income, does not serve as a viable substitute for liquid savings for agents in the hand-to-mouth state.\n\nIn our second experiment, we explored the effects of a fiscal stimulus within different combinations of the monetary/fiscal policy mix. The relative strength of the self-insurance and supply channels was found to be dependent on the policy mix. Under an active monetary policy, the supply effect dominated, while under a passive monetary policy, a larger income effect on hand-to-mouth agents made the 'self-insurance' channel stronger.\n\nIn our third and final experiment, we looked at the propagation of a monetary policy shock\n\nunder different policy mixes. We found that the fiscal stance could affect the liquidity premium and, consequently, the investment and output dynamics. In the case of an active monetary policy, a reduction in the policy rate that stimulates the economy reduces the self-insurance motive of capitalists, leading to a substitution of bonds for capital. The resulting increase in the price level reduces real debt and spending, and, as a result, the supply channel makes bonds even less attractive than capital. This effect is magnified when fiscal policy is less passive. In the case of a passive monetary policy, instead, the effect of the fiscal stance on the propagation of monetary policy shocks flips.\n\nWe also showed how comparing the simulations of the three-agent economy with those implied by a standard two-agent one demonstrates the quantitative importance of the transmission channel studied in this paper. In a two-agent economy, the absence of the 'self-insurance' channel makes monetary policy the main driver of aggregate dynamics, independently of the fiscal policy stance.\n\nThis study provides interesting insights into the complex dynamics between fiscal and monetary policy via their influence on the portfolio choices of different types of agents. It also suggests that the challenges for the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of substantial fiscal policy interventions, like in the last few years, are more complex than previously thought. Central Banks should also consider the impact of the 'self-insurance' motive on the dynamics of the liquidity premium when setting the monetary policy stance.\n\nFuture work could extend the analysis presented here along several dimensions. For example, the model economy could be modified to allow for a CES production function with complementarity between capital and labor to check if the relative strength of the 'insurance-through-investment' channel changes. Further extensions of the model should also consider the presence of distortionary taxes and targeted transfers. Finally, it would also be interesting to allow for endogenous regime switching in the fiscal policy mix.\n\nReferences\n\nAuclert, A., Rognlie, M., and Straub, L. (2024).

It also suggests that the challenges for the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of substantial fiscal policy interventions, like in the last few years, are more complex than previously thought. Central Banks should also consider the impact of the 'self-insurance' motive on the dynamics of the liquidity premium when setting the monetary policy stance.\n\nFuture work could extend the analysis presented here along several dimensions. For example, the model economy could be modified to allow for a CES production function with complementarity between capital and labor to check if the relative strength of the 'insurance-through-investment' channel changes. Further extensions of the model should also consider the presence of distortionary taxes and targeted transfers. Finally, it would also be interesting to allow for endogenous regime switching in the fiscal policy mix.\n\nReferences\n\nAuclert, A., Rognlie, M., and Straub, L. (2024).

JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks. This work represents a step toward more efficient and versatile vision-language models.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning diverse knowledge and generalizing to new scenarios [1, 7, 8, 68, 88]. Leveraging these capabilities, researchers have developed sophisticated models specialized in image comprehension [2, 15, 47, 49, 56, 57] and text-to-image generation [23, 71, 74, 77].\n\nThe field has recently shifted toward creating unified systems capable of handling both tasks simultaneously. One prominent direction involves utilizing pre-trained text-to-image models for high-quality generation while training LLMs to generate conditions for these models [19, 25-27, 84]. However, this approach introduces architectural complexity and potentially constrains the model's capabilities through maintaining separate LLM and generative components. Alternative approaches [85, 93, 95, 96, 103] propose training a single LLM for both tasks, typically incorporating either diffusion models [32, 80] or vector-quantized autoregressive models [22, 83].\n\nOur approach builds upon recent breakthroughs in rectified flow models [3, 23, 55, 60, 61], which provide a simple framework for generative modeling while delivering exceptional empir-\n\n<missing-text>\n\n(b) Visual Generation Results.\n\nical performance [23, 36, 45]. Building on these advances, we propose JanusFlow , a powerful unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates rectified flow with LLM architecture. Following a minimalist design principle, our architecture requires only a lightweight encoder and decoder to adapt the LLM for rectified flow operations. To optimize JanusFlow's performance, we implement two key strategies: First, we maintain separate vision encoders for understanding and generation tasks, preventing task interference and thus enhancing comprehension capabilities. Second, we align the intermediate representations between generation and understanding modules during training, strengthening semantic coherence in the generation process.\n\nJanusFlow shows state-of-the-art performances in both multimodal comprehension and text-to-image generation compared to existing unified approaches, and even outperforms several specialized methods. Specifically, on text-to-image generation benchmarks, MJHQ FID-30k [48], GenEval [28] and DPG-Bench [34], JanusFlow achieves scores of 9.51, 0.63 and 80.09%, surpassing established text-to-image models including SDv1.5 [75] and SDXL [71]. In multimodal comprehension benchmarks, JanusFlow attains scores of 74.9, 70.5 and 60.3 on MMBench [62], SeedBench [46], and GQA [35], respectively, exceeding specialized models such as LLaVA-v1.5 [56] and Qwen-VL-Chat [4]. Notably, these results are achieved with a compact LLM architecture with only 1.3B parameters.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nVisual Generation with Flow-based Generative Models. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in visual generation through diffusion models [32, 80], leading to impressive models like [66, 71, 74-77]. Building on these advances, flow-based generative models [3, 55, 60] emerged as a simplified alternative framework. These approaches have recently enabled advanced visual generation models [23, 36] that achieve superior empirical performance with faster sampling. Our work demonstrates that rectified flow [59-61] can be effectively integrated into LLMs, creating unified models that excel in both understanding and generation tasks.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nUnified Models For Understanding and Generation. The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled effective integration of text and visual information. Building upon powerful LLMs [7, 88, 89], recent MLLMs [2, 15, 49, 56, 57, 63] have demonstrated exceptional multimodal understanding capabilities. Current research increasingly focuses on architectures that can simultaneously handle visual understanding and generation tasks. One approach extends MLLMs with pre-trained diffusion models [19, 25-27, 84, 97]. However\n######################\nOutput:",

JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks. This work represents a step toward more efficient and versatile vision-language models.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning diverse knowledge and generalizing to new scenarios [1, 7, 8, 68, 88]. Leveraging these capabilities, researchers have developed sophisticated models specialized in image comprehension [2, 15, 47, 49, 56, 57] and text-to-image generation [23, 71, 74, 77].\n\nThe field has recently shifted toward creating unified systems capable of handling both tasks simultaneously. One prominent direction involves utilizing pre-trained text-to-image models for high-quality generation while training LLMs to generate conditions for these models [19, 25-27, 84]. However, this approach introduces architectural complexity and potentially constrains the model's capabilities through maintaining separate LLM and generative components. Alternative approaches [85, 93, 95, 96, 103] propose training a single LLM for both tasks, typically incorporating either diffusion models [32, 80] or vector-quantized autoregressive models [22, 83].\n\nOur approach builds upon recent breakthroughs in rectified flow models [3, 23, 55, 60, 61], which provide a simple framework for generative modeling while delivering exceptional empir-\n\n<missing-text>\n\n(b) Visual Generation Results.\n\nical performance [23, 36, 45]. Building on these advances, we propose JanusFlow , a powerful unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates rectified flow with LLM architecture. Following a minimalist design principle, our architecture requires only a lightweight encoder and decoder to adapt the LLM for rectified flow operations. To optimize JanusFlow's performance, we implement two key strategies: First, we maintain separate vision encoders for understanding and generation tasks, preventing task interference and thus enhancing comprehension capabilities. Second, we align the intermediate representations between generation and understanding modules during training, strengthening semantic coherence in the generation process.\n\nJanusFlow shows state-of-the-art performances in both multimodal comprehension and text-to-image generation compared to existing unified approaches, and even outperforms several specialized methods. Specifically, on text-to-image generation benchmarks, MJHQ FID-30k [48], GenEval [28] and DPG-Bench [34], JanusFlow achieves scores of 9.51, 0.63 and 80.09%, surpassing established text-to-image models including SDv1.5 [75] and SDXL [71]. In multimodal comprehension benchmarks, JanusFlow attains scores of 74.9, 70.5 and 60.3 on MMBench [62], SeedBench [46], and GQA [35], respectively, exceeding specialized models such as LLaVA-v1.5 [56] and Qwen-VL-Chat [4]. Notably, these results are achieved with a compact LLM architecture with only 1.3B parameters.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nVisual Generation with Flow-based Generative Models. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in visual generation through diffusion models [32, 80], leading to impressive models like [66, 71, 74-77]. Building on these advances, flow-based generative models [3, 55, 60] emerged as a simplified alternative framework. These approaches have recently enabled advanced visual generation models [23, 36] that achieve superior empirical performance with faster sampling. Our work demonstrates that rectified flow [59-61] can be effectively integrated into LLMs, creating unified models that excel in both understanding and generation tasks.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nUnified Models For Understanding and Generation. The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled effective integration of text and visual information. Building upon powerful LLMs [7, 88, 89], recent MLLMs [2, 15, 49, 56, 57, 63] have demonstrated exceptional multimodal understanding capabilities. Current research increasingly focuses on architectures that can simultaneously handle visual understanding and generation tasks. One approach extends MLLMs with pre-trained diffusion models [19, 25-27, 84, 97]. However"

At  upper  quantiles  (e.g.,  75th  or  90th  percentile),  a  positive  coefficient indicates  that  even  significant  emitters  (Canada,  Germany,  Japan,  and  the  USA)  see  an increase in CO₂ emissions with the rise of AI adoption. Industries with significant emissions, including energy, manufacturing, and logistics, could experience a heightened environmental  impact  from  AI  due  to  the  substantial  computing  power  and  energy consumption required for extensive AI operations.\n\nAn insignificant correlation between funding for nuclear energy technology and CO 2 emissions across quantiles suggests that variations in funding for nuclear energy technology do not significantly impact CO emissions at different levels of the emissions distribution (see Table 4). This finding may arise from multiple factors about nuclear energy investments and  the  broader  energy  production  and  emissions  context. An  insignificant  relationship across quantiles in quantile regression means this lack of effect is the same for all emissions levels,  from  lower  to  higher  quantiles.  This  consistency  indicates  that  irrespective  of  a country's status as a low or high CO₂ emitter, increases in nuclear energy funding are not presently associated with emissions reductions, reinforcing the notion that nuclear budgeting may exert limited or delayed direct effects on CO₂ emissions across various emission levels.\n\nThere is a negative coefficient for AI's moderating role in the relationship between funding for nuclear energy technology and CO 2 emissions across all quantiles. This suggests that AI may help lower the CO 2 emissions from nuclear energy projects (see Table 4). AI is a mitigating factor, diminishing the positive relationship between nuclear energy investment and emissions across all levels. The application of AI in nuclear energy development and operations indicates that its efficiencies and optimizations could lead to decreased emissions throughout the project lifecycle. At lower emission levels (10th or 25th percentile), AI may have a negative moderating effect. This means that in places with moderate emissions, AI may  reduce  the  initial  CO2  footprint  of  nuclear  energy  projects.  Figuring  out  this  may necessitate the optimization of construction and logistical procedures, reducing waste, and improvement of resource efficiency. The median quantile, or 50th percentile, for average emitters, shows that AI has a moderating effect that greatly reduces emissions related to nuclear energy projects. This is achieved through AI-driven efficiency, such as predictive\n\nmaintenance, better energy management, and automation routine tasks. There is a negative coefficient for the moderating effect of AI at high quantiles, like the 75th or 90th percentile. This means that adding AI may have a big effect on situations with high emission levels. Artificial  intelligence  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  associated  with extensive nuclear initiatives, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize the integration of nuclear facilities into the energy grid.\n\nIn  quantile  regression  analysis,  plotting  the  regression  results  across  different quantiles  provides  a  robust  check  of  how  the  relationship  between  the  independent  and dependent variables changes as the outcome variable's distribution changes. Through the graphic  representation  of  these  results,  we  can  understand  the  stability  and  variation  of coefficients,  which  helps  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  findings.  In  summary,  quantile regression plots serve as an important tool for assessing robustness by demonstrating the variability  (or  consistency)  of  coefficient  estimates  across  different  quantiles.  Consistent coefficients indicate reliability, whereas fluctuations provide understanding of distributional diversity.

        "text": "through AI  may  not adequately offset the emissions generated by data processing, storage, and computational requirements. At  upper  quantiles  (e.g.,  75th  or  90th  percentile),  a  positive  coefficient indicates  that  even  significant  emitters  (Canada,  Germany,  Japan,  and  the  USA)  see  an increase in CO₂ emissions with the rise of AI adoption. Industries with significant emissions, including energy, manufacturing, and logistics, could experience a heightened environmental  impact  from  AI  due  to  the  substantial  computing  power  and  energy consumption required for extensive AI operations.\n\nAn insignificant correlation between funding for nuclear energy technology and CO 2 emissions across quantiles suggests that variations in funding for nuclear energy technology do not significantly impact CO emissions at different levels of the emissions distribution (see Table 4). This finding may arise from multiple factors about nuclear energy investments and  the  broader  energy  production  and  emissions  context. An  insignificant  relationship across quantiles in quantile regression means this lack of effect is the same for all emissions levels,  from  lower  to  higher  quantiles.  This  consistency  indicates  that  irrespective  of  a country's status as a low or high CO₂ emitter, increases in nuclear energy funding are not presently associated with emissions reductions, reinforcing the notion that nuclear budgeting may exert limited or delayed direct effects on CO₂ emissions across various emission levels.\n\nThere is a negative coefficient for AI's moderating role in the relationship between funding for nuclear energy technology and CO 2 emissions across all quantiles. This suggests that AI may help lower the CO 2 emissions from nuclear energy projects (see Table 4). AI is a mitigating factor, diminishing the positive relationship between nuclear energy investment and emissions across all levels. The application of AI in nuclear energy development and operations indicates that its efficiencies and optimizations could lead to decreased emissions throughout the project lifecycle. At lower emission levels (10th or 25th percentile), AI may have a negative moderating effect. This means that in places with moderate emissions, AI may  reduce  the  initial  CO2  footprint  of  nuclear  energy  projects.  Figuring  out  this  may necessitate the optimization of construction and logistical procedures, reducing waste, and improvement of resource efficiency. The median quantile, or 50th percentile, for average emitters, shows that AI has a moderating effect that greatly reduces emissions related to nuclear energy projects. This is achieved through AI-driven efficiency, such as predictive\n\nmaintenance, better energy management, and automation routine tasks. There is a negative coefficient for the moderating effect of AI at high quantiles, like the 75th or 90th percentile. This means that adding AI may have a big effect on situations with high emission levels. Artificial  intelligence  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  associated  with extensive nuclear initiatives, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize the integration of nuclear facilities into the energy grid.\n\nIn  quantile  regression  analysis,  plotting  the  regression  results  across  different quantiles  provides  a  robust  check  of  how  the  relationship  between  the  independent  and dependent variables changes as the outcome variable's distribution changes. Through the graphic  representation  of  these  results,  we  can  understand  the  stability  and  variation  of coefficients,  which  helps  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  findings.  In  summary,  quantile regression plots serve as an important tool for assessing robustness by demonstrating the variability  (or  consistency)  of  coefficient  estimates  across  different  quantiles.  Consistent coefficients indicate reliability, whereas fluctuations provide understanding of distributional diversity.  This  visual  representation  bolsters  confidence  in  the  results,  especially  when dealing  with  intricate  data  that  may  include  outliers,  non-normal  distributions,  or endogeneity concerns. By validating the relationship across quantiles, quantile regression plots act as a significant instrument for evaluating the robustness and depth of empirical findings.\n\nQuantile regression plots (see Figure 4) exhibit robustness to outliers and non-normal data  distributions.  If  the  plot  indicates  that  the  coefficients  keep  their  significance  and direction across quantiles, this resilience to outliers further corroborates the stability and\n\nvalidity of the relationship.

Discussion\n\nAI directly  impacts  CO 2 emissions  positively.  First,  the  possible  reasons  are  that training and deploying AI models, especially large ones, require significant computational resources and, therefore, energy. Data centers, cloud computing, and the hardware powering AI algorithms contribute to CO₂ emissions, often more than the efficiencies gained. Second, the infrastructure supporting AI-data centers, sensors, high-performance computers, etc.demands substantial energy. This infrastructure may lead to a direct increase in emissions, especially if powered by fossil-fuel-based energy sources. Third, AI-enabled innovations can lead  to  higher  productivity,  which  might  drive  up  consumption  and  production.  This 'rebound  effect'  can  result  in  higher  energy  demand  and  emissions,  offsetting  the efficiencies brought by AI. This positive association across all quantiles signals a potential trade-off: while AI offers benefits, its environmental costs need careful management to avoid inadvertently  worsening  CO₂  emissions  on  a  large  scale.  Overall,  an  insignificant relationship across quantiles highlights the complex and potentially indirect role of nuclear energy budgeting in emissions reduction. This finding suggests that while nuclear energy funding is crucial for long-term energy strategy, immediate and observable impacts on CO₂ emissions  may  require  additional  complementary  investments  and  policy  measures  to amplify the potential emissions reduction benefits of nuclear energy.\n\nIn many countries, nuclear energy is part of a diverse energy mix, and the impact of nuclear budgeting on CO₂ emissions may be diluted by the presence of other energy sources, especially  if  fossil  fuels  still  constitute  a  large  share  of  the  energy  supply. As  a  result, increases in nuclear funding may not have a strong, immediate, or quantifiable effect on emissions, especially if nuclear power generation remains a smaller portion of the overall\n\nenergy  grid.  Nuclear  energy  indirectly  reduces  CO₂  emissions  by  offsetting  reliance  on carbon-intensive fossil fuels. However, if nuclear investments are primarily allocated toward safety improvements, decommissioning, or research and development rather than increasing capacity, the immediate effect on CO₂ emissions could be minimal or difficult to detect. The quantile  regression  showing  insignificant  results  across  quantiles  could  suggest  that  any potential impact of nuclear budgeting on emissions may only become significant above a certain threshold of funding or nuclear capacity, which the current budget levels have not yet  reached.  This  threshold  effect  could  mean  that  without  reaching  substantial  nuclear capacity  expansion,  the  impact  on  emissions  remains  marginal.  The  creative  design  of advanced nuclear energy systems, thorough research and development, and widespread use of  next-generation  advanced  nuclear  energy  technology  will  increase  the  economy's competitiveness and enhance the safety of the nuclear energy system (Zhan et al., 2021).\n\nAI can aid in the planning, scheduling, and managing of nuclear plant construction, optimize resource utilization, and mitigate delays. AI can enhance supply chain efficiency and  minimize  transportation  requirements,  reducing  the  indirect  CO 2 emissions  of construction  activities. After  nuclear  plants  become  operational, AI  can  improve  energy efficiency by precisely aligning energy production with demand, thereby minimizing excess energy production and related emissions. AI algorithms can forecast and mitigate equipment problems  before  failures,  decreasing  the  necessity  for  energy-intensive  repairs  and minimizing potential downtime. This may also prolong the lifespan of equipment, thereby reducing the frequency of replacements and the related manufacturing emissions. Artificial intelligence can facilitate the integration of nuclear energy into the energy grid by balancing supply  and  demand,  optimizing  energy  storage,  and  minimizing  waste.  This  mitigates\n\nemissions from backup fossil-fuel power sources that may be required for grid stabilization. Artificial intelligence can enhance waste management processes and resource utilization, thereby  minimizing  material  waste  and  emissions  associated  with  waste  disposal  or recycling. In sum, this negative moderating effect highlights AI's potential to make nuclear energy  development  more  sustainable.  By  reducing  emissions  associated  with  nuclear projects  across  all  quantiles,  AI  could  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  cleaner  energy solutions and enhancing the environmental sustainability of nuclear power across various levels of existing emissions.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe issue of global warming is likely to persist, even beyond the established deadline for reaching carbon neutrality and the 1.5°C temperature increase threshold.

Conclusion\n\nThe issue of global warming is likely to persist, even beyond the established deadline for reaching carbon neutrality and the 1.5°C temperature increase threshold. Despite their knowledge of major greenhouse gases, scientists and policymakers struggle to accurately capture CO 2 emissions dynamics about their pathways (GHGs) (Magazzino et al., 2024). In this regard, we identified gaps in the literature regarding the analysis of the interactions of AI and nuclear energy technology budgeting (composite variable) with CO 2 emissions. Thus, this study employed a robust econometric approach in evaluating the present relationships between  AI  and  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  (composite  variable)  with  CO 2 emissions.  On  the  methodological  side,  we  introduce  a  novel  approach  by  introducing moderating AI in the relationship between nuclear energy technology budgeting and CO 2 emissions. For empirical estimates, the study relies on the MM-QR method.  Here, we were able  to  demonstrate  that  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  does  influence  all  CO 2 emissions. We also observed that AI could contribute to CO 2 emissions directly. However, novel findings related to the interaction effect of AI and nuclear energy technology budget,\n\nthe  findings  reveal  that  nuclear  energy  technology  budgeting  reduces  carbon  emissions through AI.\n\nPolicymakers  may  need  to  introduce  incentives  for  renewable  energy  use  in AIrelated  operations  or  promote  the  development  of  more  energy-efficient AI  algorithms. Governments could conduct thorough environmental impact assessments for AI initiatives, especially in industries that are heavy emitters. Efforts to develop AI solutions specifically targeted  at  reducing  emissions  and  enhancing  energy  efficiency  should  be  prioritized  to counteract  the  possible  environmental  costs  of  AI  deployment.  Policymakers  and stakeholders  need  to  consider  the  short-term  emissions  increase  associated  with  nuclear energy  development  against  its  long-term  potential  for  low-emission  energy  production. Clear strategies  can  help  bridge  the  gap  until  the  emissions-reducing  benefits  of  nuclear power are realized. Emissions during the construction and development phases could be minimized by adopting low-carbon materials, recycling construction waste, and utilizing renewable energy for construction activities. Investing in nuclear energy might be balanced with other renewable options, like solar and wind, that have shorter development times and can begin reducing emissions sooner. This integrated strategy could help mitigate the shortterm  emissions  spike  often  linked  to  the  development  of  nuclear  energy.  A  positive coefficient  may  raise  concerns  among  stakeholders  or  the  public,  who  expect  nuclear investments to lead to lower emissions. Therefore, it is essential to communicate effectively about nuclear project lifecycle emissions, including the initial increase in emissions and the long-term benefits. This communication is vital for managing expectations.\n\nPolicymakers and stakeholders should prioritize allocating funding and resources to integrate AI in nuclear energy projects, as this approach has the potential to enhance the\n\nenvironmental advantages of nuclear energy by reducing CO 2 emissions. Targeted research into AI applications for emission reduction can further improve its moderating effect. This could involve creating targeted AI algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, optimize carbon capture, and facilitate predictive maintenance designed explicitly for nuclear facilities. The partnership between the AI and nuclear energy sectors has the potential to foster innovations that  leverage  AI's  capabilities  to  reduce  emissions,  establishing  industry  standards  and frameworks  for  implementing AI  in  nuclear  initiatives.  Despite  the  long-term  nature  of nuclear  projects,  a  negative  moderating  role  of  AI  could  accelerate  the  realization  of emissions reduction benefits. Transparent reporting of these benefits may assist in managing public and stakeholder expectations, illustrating AI's role in enhancing the environmental viability of nuclear energy.\n\nThe research highlights several significant limitations: obtaining reliable, real-time data on nuclear operations and budgets, as well as the adoption of AI in the nuclear sector, is  often  hindered  by  confidentiality  and  regulatory  restrictions.  This  scarcity  of  data undermines the accuracy of AI model predictions and restricts the study's ability to reflect current technological and financial trends. Additionally, variations in data availability and accuracy across different regions pose substantial challenges in generalizing findings on a global  scale.  Furthermore,  differing  reporting  standards  among  nations  could  affect  the study's ability to consistently evaluate the impact of AI on nuclear energy investment and emissions reduction.\n\nReferences\n\nÁlvarez-herránz, A., Balsalobre, D., Cantos, J.M., Shahbaz, M., 2017.

Clear strategies  can  help  bridge  the  gap  until  the  emissions-reducing  benefits  of  nuclear power are realized. Emissions during the construction and development phases could be minimized by adopting low-carbon materials, recycling construction waste, and utilizing renewable energy for construction activities. Investing in nuclear energy might be balanced with other renewable options, like solar and wind, that have shorter development times and can begin reducing emissions sooner. This integrated strategy could help mitigate the shortterm  emissions  spike  often  linked  to  the  development  of  nuclear  energy.  A  positive coefficient  may  raise  concerns  among  stakeholders  or  the  public,  who  expect  nuclear investments to lead to lower emissions. Therefore, it is essential to communicate effectively about nuclear project lifecycle emissions, including the initial increase in emissions and the long-term benefits. This communication is vital for managing expectations.\n\nPolicymakers and stakeholders should prioritize allocating funding and resources to integrate AI in nuclear energy projects, as this approach has the potential to enhance the\n\nenvironmental advantages of nuclear energy by reducing CO 2 emissions. Targeted research into AI applications for emission reduction can further improve its moderating effect. This could involve creating targeted AI algorithms to enhance energy efficiency, optimize carbon capture, and facilitate predictive maintenance designed explicitly for nuclear facilities. The partnership between the AI and nuclear energy sectors has the potential to foster innovations that  leverage  AI's  capabilities  to  reduce  emissions,  establishing  industry  standards  and frameworks  for  implementing AI  in  nuclear  initiatives.  Despite  the  long-term  nature  of nuclear  projects,  a  negative  moderating  role  of  AI  could  accelerate  the  realization  of emissions reduction benefits. Transparent reporting of these benefits may assist in managing public and stakeholder expectations, illustrating AI's role in enhancing the environmental viability of nuclear energy.\n\nThe research highlights several significant limitations: obtaining reliable, real-time data on nuclear operations and budgets, as well as the adoption of AI in the nuclear sector, is  often  hindered  by  confidentiality  and  regulatory  restrictions.  This  scarcity  of  data undermines the accuracy of AI model predictions and restricts the study's ability to reflect current technological and financial trends. Additionally, variations in data availability and accuracy across different regions pose substantial challenges in generalizing findings on a global  scale.  Furthermore,  differing  reporting  standards  among  nations  could  affect  the study's ability to consistently evaluate the impact of AI on nuclear energy investment and emissions reduction.\n\nReferences\n\nÁlvarez-herránz, A., Balsalobre, D., Cantos, J.M., Shahbaz, M., 2017.

PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholarly queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4 for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50. It also exceeds PaSaGPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. Model, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/bytedance/pasa .\n\nAcademic paper search lies at the core of research yet represents a particularly challenging information retrieval task. It requires long-tail specialized knowledge, comprehensive survey-level coverage, and the ability to address fine-grained queries. For instance, consider the query: \"Which studies have focused on non-stationary reinforcement learning using value-based methods, specifically UCB-based algorithms?\" While widely used academic search systems like Google Scholar are effective for general queries, they often fall short when addressing these complex queries (Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2020). Consequently, researchers frequently spend substantial time conducting literature surveys (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021).\n\nThe advancements in large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Gemini, 2023; Yang et al., 2024) have inspired numerous studies leveraging LLMs to enhance information retrieval, particularly by refining or reformulating search queries to improve retrieval quality (Alaofi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). In academic search, however, the process goes beyond simple retrieval. Human researchers not only use search tools, but also engage in deeper activities, such as reading relevant papers and checking citations, to perform comprehensive and accurate literature surveys.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nIn this paper, we introduce PaSa, a novel paper search agent designed to mimic human behavior for comprehensive and accurate academic paper searches. As illustrated in Figure 1, PaSa consists of two LLM agents: the Crawler and the Selector. For a given user query, the Crawler can autonomously collect relevant papers by utilizing search tools or extracting citations from the current paper, which are then added to a growing paper queue . The Crawler iteratively processes each paper in the paper queue, navigating citation networks to discover increasingly relevant papers. The Selector carefully reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the requirements of the user query. We optimize PaSa within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for LLM agents (Feng et al., 2024).\n\nEffective training requires high-quality academic search data. Fortunately, human scientists have already created a vast amount of high-quality academic papers, which contain extensive surveys on a wide range of research topics. We build a synthetic but high-quality academic search dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which collects fine-grained scholar queries and their corresponding relevant papers from the related work sections of papers published at ICLR 2023 1 , ICML 2023 2 , NeurIPS 2023 3 , ACL 2024 4 , and CVPR 2024 5 . AutoScholarQuery includes 33,511 / 1,000 / 1,000 query-paper pairs in the training / development / test split.\n\nAlthough AutoScholarQuery only provides query and paper answers, without demonstrating the path by which scientists collect the papers, we can utilize them to perform RL training to improve PaSa. In addition, we design a new session-level PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017)) training method to address the unique challenges of the paper search task: 1) sparse reward: The papers in AutoScholarQuery are collected via citations, making it a smaller subset of the actual qualified paper set. 2) long trajectories: The complete trajectory of the Crawler may involve hundreds of papers, which is too long to directly input into the LLM context.\n\nTo evaluate PaSa, besides the test set of AutoScholarQuery, we also develop a benchmark, RealScholarQuery. It contains 50 real-world academic queries with\n######################\nOutput:",

Consequently, researchers frequently spend substantial time conducting literature surveys (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021).\n\nThe advancements in large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Gemini, 2023; Yang et al., 2024) have inspired numerous studies leveraging LLMs to enhance information retrieval, particularly by refining or reformulating search queries to improve retrieval quality (Alaofi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). In academic search, however, the process goes beyond simple retrieval. Human researchers not only use search tools, but also engage in deeper activities, such as reading relevant papers and checking citations, to perform comprehensive and accurate literature surveys.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nIn this paper, we introduce PaSa, a novel paper search agent designed to mimic human behavior for comprehensive and accurate academic paper searches. As illustrated in Figure 1, PaSa consists of two LLM agents: the Crawler and the Selector. For a given user query, the Crawler can autonomously collect relevant papers by utilizing search tools or extracting citations from the current paper, which are then added to a growing paper queue . The Crawler iteratively processes each paper in the paper queue, navigating citation networks to discover increasingly relevant papers. The Selector carefully reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the requirements of the user query. We optimize PaSa within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for LLM agents (Feng et al., 2024).\n\nEffective training requires high-quality academic search data. Fortunately, human scientists have already created a vast amount of high-quality academic papers, which contain extensive surveys on a wide range of research topics. We build a synthetic but high-quality academic search dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which collects fine-grained scholar queries and their corresponding relevant papers from the related work sections of papers published at ICLR 2023 1 , ICML 2023 2 , NeurIPS 2023 3 , ACL 2024 4 , and CVPR 2024 5 . AutoScholarQuery includes 33,511 / 1,000 / 1,000 query-paper pairs in the training / development / test split.\n\nAlthough AutoScholarQuery only provides query and paper answers, without demonstrating the path by which scientists collect the papers, we can utilize them to perform RL training to improve PaSa. In addition, we design a new session-level PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017)) training method to address the unique challenges of the paper search task: 1) sparse reward: The papers in AutoScholarQuery are collected via citations, making it a smaller subset of the actual qualified paper set. 2) long trajectories: The complete trajectory of the Crawler may involve hundreds of papers, which is too long to directly input into the LLM context.\n\nTo evaluate PaSa, besides the test set of AutoScholarQuery, we also develop a benchmark, RealScholarQuery. It contains 50 real-world academic queries with"

It contains 50 real-world academic queries with annotated relevant papers, to assess PaSa in real-world scenarios. We compare PaSa with several baselines including Google, Google Scholar, Google paired with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT4o), GPT-o1 and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa agent realized by prompting GPT-4o). Our experiments show that PaSa-7b significantly outperforms all baselines. Specifically, for AutoScholarQuery test set, PaSa7b achieves a 34.05% improvement in Recall@20 and a 39.36% improvement in Recall@50 compared to Google with GPT-4o, the strongest Googlebased baseline. PaSa-7b surpasses PaSa-GPT-4o by 11.12% in recall, with similar precision. For RealScholarQuery, PaSa-7b outperforms Google with GPT-4o by 37.78% in Recall@20 and 39.90% in Recall@50. PaSa-7b surpasses PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n · We introduce PaSa, a comprehensive and accurate paper search agent that can autonomously use online search tools, read entire papers, and navigate citation networks.\n\n · We develop two high-quality datasets for complex academic search, AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery.\n\n · Although PaSa is trained solely on synthetic data, it achieves remarkable real-world performance. Experiments demonstrate that PaSa, built on 7B LLM, significantly outperforms all baselines, including GPT-4 agent, Googlebased search, and chatGPT.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nLLMs in Scientific Discovery LLMs have been applied across various stages of scientific discovery (Van Noorden and Perkel, 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Messeri and Crockett, 2024; Liao et al., 2024), such as brainstorming ideas (Girotra et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Baek et al., 2024), designing experiments (M. Bran et al., 2024), writing code (Xu et al., 2022), and generating research papers (Shao et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). One of the most fundamental yet critical stages in research is conducting academic surveys. Despite its importance, current tools like Google Scholar are often insufficient, leading researchers to spend considerable time on literature review tasks (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021, 2020). This challenge motivates us to develop PaSa, an LLM agent designed to autonomously and comprehensively assist researchers in collecting relevant research papers for complex scholarly queries.\n\nLLM Agents LLM Agents combine LLMs with memory, tool use, and planning, enabling them to perform more complex tasks such as personal copilots (Stratton, 2024), travel planning (Gundawar et al., 2024), web operations (Deng et al., 2024), software development (Qian et al., 2023), and scientific experimentation (Bran et al., 2023). In addition to realizing LLM Agents through prompt engineering (Park et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), recent research has focused on optimizing and training these agents (Feng et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Liu\n\net al., 2023). Among these efforts, AGILE (Feng et al., 2024), a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents, allows the joint optimization of all agent skills in an end-to-end manner. In our work, we adopt the AGILE framework to implement PaSa. Specifically, we design a novel session-level PPO algorithm to address the unique challenges of the paper search task, including sparse rewards and long trajectories.\n\n3 Datasets\n\n3.1 AutoScholarQuery\n\nAutoScholarQuery is a synthetic but high-quality dataset of academic queries and related papers, specifically curated for the AI field.\n\nTo construct AutoScholarQuery, we began by collecting all papers published at ICLR 2023, ICML 2023, NeurIPS 2023, ACL 2024, and CVPR 2024. For the Related Work section of each paper, we prompted GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) to generate scholarly queries, where the answers to these queries correspond to the references cited in the Related Work section. The prompt used is shown in Appendix E.1. For each query, we retained only the papers that could be retrieved on arXiv 6 , using their arxiv\\_id as the unique article identifier in the dataset. We adopt the publication date of the source paper as the query date. During both training and testing, we only considered papers published prior to the query date.\n\nThe final AutoScholarQuery dataset comprises 33,551,\n######################\nOutput:",

It contains 50 real-world academic queries with annotated relevant papers, to assess PaSa in real-world scenarios. We compare PaSa with several baselines including Google, Google Scholar, Google paired with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT4o), GPT-o1 and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa agent realized by prompting GPT-4o). Our experiments show that PaSa-7b significantly outperforms all baselines. Specifically, for AutoScholarQuery test set, PaSa7b achieves a 34.05% improvement in Recall@20 and a 39.36% improvement in Recall@50 compared to Google with GPT-4o, the strongest Googlebased baseline. PaSa-7b surpasses PaSa-GPT-4o by 11.12% in recall, with similar precision. For RealScholarQuery, PaSa-7b outperforms Google with GPT-4o by 37.78% in Recall@20 and 39.90% in Recall@50. PaSa-7b surpasses PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n · We introduce PaSa, a comprehensive and accurate paper search agent that can autonomously use online search tools, read entire papers, and navigate citation networks.\n\n · We develop two high-quality datasets for complex academic search, AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery.\n\n · Although PaSa is trained solely on synthetic data, it achieves remarkable real-world performance. Experiments demonstrate that PaSa, built on 7B LLM, significantly outperforms all baselines, including GPT-4 agent, Googlebased search, and chatGPT.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nLLMs in Scientific Discovery LLMs have been applied across various stages of scientific discovery (Van Noorden and Perkel, 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Messeri and Crockett, 2024; Liao et al., 2024), such as brainstorming ideas (Girotra et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Baek et al., 2024), designing experiments (M. Bran et al., 2024), writing code (Xu et al., 2022), and generating research papers (Shao et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). One of the most fundamental yet critical stages in research is conducting academic surveys. Despite its importance, current tools like Google Scholar are often insufficient, leading researchers to spend considerable time on literature review tasks (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021, 2020). This challenge motivates us to develop PaSa, an LLM agent designed to autonomously and comprehensively assist researchers in collecting relevant research papers for complex scholarly queries.\n\nLLM Agents LLM Agents combine LLMs with memory, tool use, and planning, enabling them to perform more complex tasks such as personal copilots (Stratton, 2024), travel planning (Gundawar et al., 2024), web operations (Deng et al., 2024), software development (Qian et al., 2023), and scientific experimentation (Bran et al., 2023). In addition to realizing LLM Agents through prompt engineering (Park et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), recent research has focused on optimizing and training these agents (Feng et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Liu\n\net al., 2023). Among these efforts, AGILE (Feng et al., 2024), a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents, allows the joint optimization of all agent skills in an end-to-end manner. In our work, we adopt the AGILE framework to implement PaSa. Specifically, we design a novel session-level PPO algorithm to address the unique challenges of the paper search task, including sparse rewards and long trajectories.\n\n3 Datasets\n\n3.1 AutoScholarQuery\n\nAutoScholarQuery is a synthetic but high-quality dataset of academic queries and related papers, specifically curated for the AI field.\n\nTo construct AutoScholarQuery, we began by collecting all papers published at ICLR 2023, ICML 2023, NeurIPS 2023, ACL 2024, and CVPR 2024. For the Related Work section of each paper, we prompted GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) to generate scholarly queries, where the answers to these queries correspond to the references cited in the Related Work section. The prompt used is shown in Appendix E.1. For each query, we retained only the papers that could be retrieved on arXiv 6 , using their arxiv\\_id as the unique article identifier in the dataset. We adopt the publication date of the source paper as the query date. During both training and testing, we only considered papers published prior to the query date.\n\nThe final AutoScholarQuery dataset comprises 33,551,"

Consumption, Z's, and B's are island-wide figures (multiplied by the population sizes Π 's).\n\nThe general transmission mechanism is the one established in the New Keynesian literature for this type of shock. A negative technology shock increases the real marginal costs, which determines an increase in inflation. Furthermore, it also generates a decrease in investments and a rise in labor hours. Importantly, we can see that a negative TFP shock relaxes the self-insurance mechanism we highlight in this paper. In particular, the rise in hours determines an increase in the consumption\n\nof hand-to-mouth, which decreases the desirability of liquid government bonds for self-insurance purposes (becoming hand-to-mouth becomes less undesirable). This can be seen from the portfolio choice of capitalists, who reduce their holdings of this type of asset. On the other hand, for savers who only have access to the bond markets, the standard interest rate channel is dominant, and they respond to the rise in interest rate by investing more and consuming less. Given the current calibration, we see that the bond holdings of hand-to-mouth follow a similar path as that of savers, which further improves the rise in consumption of the former. In line with the lower demand for self-insurance of the capitalists, the liquidity premium, which quantifies the insurance value of government bonds as pointed out in Proposition 1, decreases.\n\nBy moving to a comparative analysis across regimes, we can see how different combinations affect the portfolio channel and, therefore, the aggregate dynamics in the economy. In particular, a comparison across Figures 1 and 2 shows how a more active monetary policy in response to an inflationary technology shock induces stronger and more persistent movements in output, and consequently, a smaller increase in hours. Importantly, this logic is not peculiar to technology shocks but will hold for all supply shocks that move inflation and output in opposite directions in the context of a monetary policymaker that does pure inflation targeting, such as a cost-push shock: a stronger monetary policy response to tame inflation is going to have a destabilizing effect on output which will limit the response of hours. This translates, in general, into a lower increase in hand-to-mouth consumption and a higher decline in capitalist consumption. As a consequence, the decline in the liquidity premium, on impact, is similar to the one of Figure 1. However, its persistence is much higher now when less passive fiscal policy is at play.\n\nThis is because the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy brings a further mechanism at play, which was not evident in the case of passive monetary policy. After an initial decrease due to the shift in capitalists' portfolios and counterbalanced by a decrease in taxes for government budget constraint to hold, real government debt experiences a rise for two reasons, i.e., the increasing demand of capitalists and the increased interest payments on the existing stock. The strength of this rise is driven by the monetary reaction as well as how strongly the government tries to stabilize\n\nit through taxes. In particular, if the fiscal policy does not react strongly to the change in debt, the stock of government debt is going to follow a more strongly increasing path, coupled with an active monetary policymaker that changes rates aggressively and raises the interest payments on government debt. This is evident in Figure 2. This strong increase in the supply of real government debt has a feedback effect on the liquidity premium, which takes longer to recover.\n\nFurthermore, we can see how different fiscal policy stances affect the liquidity premium and, consequently, capital investment and, ultimately, output. When monetary policy is active, a passive fiscal policy delivers a lower decline in investment and output. This supply effect is largely non-present in Figure 1, where we see that with passive monetary policy, the fiscal stance does not affect the macroeconomic variables. Our simulations also show that, for a supply shock, the trade-off between self-insurance and 'insurance-through-investment' 7 is resolved in favor of the former. In fact, following a negative TFP shock, a decrease in investment increases the demand for labor and creates a substitution effect that improves the position of the hand-to-mouth. This might be overturned in the presence of a more general production function, e.g., of the CES form, which would allow for complementarity between capital and labor.\n\nFinally, we want to show the importance of the portfolio channel via the liquidity premium for the transmission of supply shocks, compared to the standard transmission mechanism. To do so, in online Appendix D, we provide simulations of the two-agent version of the model (by setting Π 𝑆 = 0, and 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 = 0 . 98 as in Bilbiie et al. (2022) and Bilbiie et al. (2023)) where there are no savers and therefore there are no meaningful portfolio choices of capitalists affecting the demand for Government debt. Results show that in the two-agent economy, the dynamics are mainly driven by the monetary authority independently of the fiscal stance. This is because the self-insurance channel is not present in this economy, and therefore, the liquidity premium barely moves.\n\n3.2 Fiscal Shock\n\nHow does fiscal policy transmit with different combinations of the monetary/fiscal policy mix? We answer this question by looking at the shock to government spending and focusing our attention on the effect on real public debt when different combinations of monetary and fiscal policy lead to different behaviors of inflation.\n\nFigure 3 shows the responses of key variables to a persistent ( 𝜌 𝑔 = 0 . 9) increase in G of 1% in terms of output for the case of active monetary policy. 8 The increase in government purchases raises the level of aggregate demand in the economy.

Consumption, Z's, and B's are island-wide figures (multiplied by the population sizes Π 's).\n\nThe general transmission mechanism is the one established in the New Keynesian literature for this type of shock. A negative technology shock increases the real marginal costs, which determines an increase in inflation. Furthermore, it also generates a decrease in investments and a rise in labor hours. Importantly, we can see that a negative TFP shock relaxes the self-insurance mechanism we highlight in this paper. In particular, the rise in hours determines an increase in the consumption\n\nof hand-to-mouth, which decreases the desirability of liquid government bonds for self-insurance purposes (becoming hand-to-mouth becomes less undesirable). This can be seen from the portfolio choice of capitalists, who reduce their holdings of this type of asset. On the other hand, for savers who only have access to the bond markets, the standard interest rate channel is dominant, and they respond to the rise in interest rate by investing more and consuming less. Given the current calibration, we see that the bond holdings of hand-to-mouth follow a similar path as that of savers, which further improves the rise in consumption of the former. In line with the lower demand for self-insurance of the capitalists, the liquidity premium, which quantifies the insurance value of government bonds as pointed out in Proposition 1, decreases.\n\nBy moving to a comparative analysis across regimes, we can see how different combinations affect the portfolio channel and, therefore, the aggregate dynamics in the economy. In particular, a comparison across Figures 1 and 2 shows how a more active monetary policy in response to an inflationary technology shock induces stronger and more persistent movements in output, and consequently, a smaller increase in hours. Importantly, this logic is not peculiar to technology shocks but will hold for all supply shocks that move inflation and output in opposite directions in the context of a monetary policymaker that does pure inflation targeting, such as a cost-push shock: a stronger monetary policy response to tame inflation is going to have a destabilizing effect on output which will limit the response of hours. This translates, in general, into a lower increase in hand-to-mouth consumption and a higher decline in capitalist consumption. As a consequence, the decline in the liquidity premium, on impact, is similar to the one of Figure 1. However, its persistence is much higher now when less passive fiscal policy is at play.\n\nThis is because the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy brings a further mechanism at play, which was not evident in the case of passive monetary policy. After an initial decrease due to the shift in capitalists' portfolios and counterbalanced by a decrease in taxes for government budget constraint to hold, real government debt experiences a rise for two reasons, i.e., the increasing demand of capitalists and the increased interest payments on the existing stock. The strength of this rise is driven by the monetary reaction as well as how strongly the government tries to stabilize\n\nit through taxes. In particular, if the fiscal policy does not react strongly to the change in debt, the stock of government debt is going to follow a more strongly increasing path, coupled with an active monetary policymaker that changes rates aggressively and raises the interest payments on government debt. This is evident in Figure 2. This strong increase in the supply of real government debt has a feedback effect on the liquidity premium, which takes longer to recover.\n\nFurthermore, we can see how different fiscal policy stances affect the liquidity premium and, consequently, capital investment and, ultimately, output. When monetary policy is active, a passive fiscal policy delivers a lower decline in investment and output. This supply effect is largely non-present in Figure 1, where we see that with passive monetary policy, the fiscal stance does not affect the macroeconomic variables. Our simulations also show that, for a supply shock, the trade-off between self-insurance and 'insurance-through-investment' 7 is resolved in favor of the former. In fact, following a negative TFP shock, a decrease in investment increases the demand for labor and creates a substitution effect that improves the position of the hand-to-mouth. This might be overturned in the presence of a more general production function, e.g., of the CES form, which would allow for complementarity between capital and labor.\n\nFinally, we want to show the importance of the portfolio channel via the liquidity premium for the transmission of supply shocks, compared to the standard transmission mechanism. To do so, in online Appendix D, we provide simulations of the two-agent version of the model (by setting Π 𝑆 = 0, and 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 = 0 . 98 as in Bilbiie et al. (2022) and Bilbiie et al.

The prompt used is shown in Appendix E.1. For each query, we retained only the papers that could be retrieved on arXiv 6 , using their arxiv\\_id as the unique article identifier in the dataset. We adopt the publication date of the source paper as the query date. During both training and testing, we only considered papers published prior to the query date.\n\nThe final AutoScholarQuery dataset comprises 33,551, 1,000, and 1,000 instances in the training, development, and testing splits, respectively. Each instance consists of a query, the associated paper set, and the query date, with queries in each split derived from distinct source papers. Table 1 provides illustrative examples from AutoScholarQuery, while additional dataset statistics are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTo evaluate the quality of AutoScholarQuery, we sampled 100 query-paper pairs and assessed the rationality and relevance of each query and the corresponding paper. A qualified query should be meaningful and unambiguous. A qualified paper should match the requirements of the scholarly query.

After launching the demo of PaSa, we invited several AI researchers to use the system. From the queries they provided, we randomly sampled a subset of queries and manually filtered out overly broad topics (e.g., \"multi-modal large language models,\" \"video generation\"). Ultimately, we collected 50 fine-grained and realistic queries.\n\nFor each query, we first manually gathered relevant papers. Subsequently, we used multiple methods to retrieve additional papers, including PaSa, Google, Google Scholar, ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), and Google paired with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries. The results from these methods were aggregated into a pool of candidate papers. Finally, professional annotators reviewed all candidate papers for each query, selecting those that\n\nmet the specific requirements of the query to create the final set of relevant papers. The query date of all instances in RealScholarQuery is 2024-10-01. Table 12 in Appendix D provides examples from RealScholarQuery.\n\nThe annotators included professors from the Department of Computer Science at a top-tier university in China. On average, each query required the annotators to review 76 candidate papers. Given the high cost of the annotations, we completed this process for only 50 instances.\n\n4 Methodology\n\n4.1 Overview\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the PaSa system consists of two LLM agents: Crawler and Selector. The crawler reads the user's query, generates multiple search queries, and retrieves relevant papers. The retrieved papers are added to a paper queue . The Crawler further processes each paper in the paper queue to identify key citations worth exploring further, appending any newly relevant papers to the paper list. The selector conducts a thorough review of each paper in the paper list to assess whether it fulfills the user's query requirements.\n\nIn summary, the Crawler is designed to maximize the recall of relevant papers, whereas the Selector emphasizes precision in identifying papers that meet the user's needs.\n\nIs there any works that analyze the scaling law of the multi-module models, such as video-text, image-text models.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n4.2 Crawler\n\nIn RL terminology, the Crawler performs a tokenlevel Markov Decision Process (MDP). The action space A corresponds to the LLM's vocabulary, where each token represents an action. The LLM functions as the policy model. The agent's state is defined by the current LLM context and the paper queue. The Crawler operates with three registered functions, as outlined in Table 3. When an action matches a function name, the corresponding function is executed, further modifying the agent's state.\n\nFor example, as Figure 2 shows, the agent begins by receiving a user query, incorporating it into its context, and initiating actions. If the token generated is [Search] , the LLM continues to generate a search query, and the agent invokes a search tool to retrieve papers, which are then added to the paper list. If the token is [Expand] , the LLM continues to extract a subsection name from the current pa-\n\nper in its context. The agent subsequently uses a parsing tool to extract all referenced papers within that subsection, adding them to the paper list. If the token is [Stop] , the agent resets its context to the user query and information of the next paper in the paper queue. This information includes the title, abstract, and an outline of all sections and subsections.\n\nThe training process for the Crawler comprises two stages. In the first stage, we generate trajectories for a small subset of the training data and then perform imitation learning (see Appendix A.1 for details). In the second stage, reinforcement learning is applied. The details of the RL training implementation are described below.\n\nReward Design We conduct RL training on the AutoScholarQuery training set, where each instance consists of a query q and a corresponding paper set P . Starting with a query q , the Crawler generates a trajectory τ = ( s 1 , a 1 , · · · , s T , a T ) . At each time step t , we denote the current paper queue as Q t . Upon taking action a t , the Crawler appends a set of new papers ( p 1 , p 2 , · · · , p n t ) to the paper queue. If a\n######################\nOutput:",

It can perform multiple searches, paper reading, and citation network crawling.\n\nWe carefully designed prompts for all baselines and they are shown in Appendix E.1.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the crawling process of PaSa can be visualized as a paper tree. In practice, considering the computational expense, we limit the Crawler's exploration depth (starting from the user query) to three for both PaSa-7b and PaSaGPT-4o.\n\nFor Google-based baselines, we evaluate recall using Recall@20, Recall@50, and Recall@100 metrics for the top-20, top-50, and top-100 search results, respectively. For other baselines, we assess precision and recall for the final retrieved papers. Additionally, we compare the crawler's recall between PaSa-GPT-4o and PaSa-7b.\n\n5.3 Main results\n\nAs shown in Table 5, PaSa-7b outperforms all baselines on AutoScholarQuery test set. Specifically,\n\ncompared to the strongest baseline, PaSa-GPT-4o, PaSa-7b demonstrates a 9.64% improvement in recall with comparable precision. Moreover, the recall of the Crawler in PaSa-7b is 3.66% higher than that in PaSa-GPT-4o. When compared to the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa7b achieves an improvement of 33.80%, 38.83% and 42.64% in Recall@20, Recall@50 and Recall@100, respectively.\n\nWe observe that using multiple ensembles of Crawler during inference can improve performance. Specifically, running Crawler twice during inference increased the Crawler recall by 3.34% on AutoScholarQuery, leading to the final recall improvement by 1.51%, with precision remaining similar.\n\nTo evaluate PaSa in a more realistic setting, we assess its effectiveness on RealScholarQuery. As illustrated in Table 6, PaSa-7b exhibits a greater advantage in real-world academic search scenarios. Compared to PaSa-GPT-4o, PaSa-7b achieves improvements of 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. Against the best Google-based baseline on RealScholarQuery, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa7b outperforms Google by 37.78%, 39.90%, and 39.83% in recall@20, recall@50 and recall@100, respectively. Additionally, the PaSa-7b-ensemble further enhances crawler recall by 4.32%, contributing to an overall 3.52% improvement in the recall\n\nof the entire agent system.\n\nAs both the final decision-maker and auxiliary reward model in RL training for the Crawler, the performance of the Selector is crucial. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected a dataset of 200 query-paper pairs, annotating whether each paper meets the query's requirements. This dataset serves as the benchmark for evaluating the Selector (see Appendix C for details). We then compared our Selector against GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and Qwen-2.5-7b (Yang et al., 2024), as shown in Table 7. The results show that our Selector achieves an F1 score of 85%, outperforming GPT-4o by 5% and Qwen-2.5-7b by 30%. Additionally, when compared to a setting where reasoning precedes decision token generation, the performance is comparable. Lastly, the Selector's precision reaches 95%, confirming its effectiveness as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler RL training.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n5.4 Ablation study\n\nWe perform ablation studies in Table 8 to evaluate the individual contributions of exploring citation networks, RL training, and using the Selector as the reward model. The results indicate that removing the [Expand] action from the Crawler leads to a significant drop in the recall: a decrease of 22.98% on AutoScholarQuery and 32.21% on RealScholarQuery. Furthermore, RL training enhances recall by 6.24% on AutoScholarQuery and 19.96% on RealScholarQuery. The RL training curves are depicted in Figure 3, where the training curves show a steady increase in return with the training steps, eventually converging after 200 steps. Finally, removing the Selector as an auxiliary reward model results in a 3.76% recall drop on AutoScholarQuery and a 9.63% drop on RealScholarQuery.\n\nWe investigate how to control agent behavior by adjusting the rewards in RL training. Experiments are conducted with varying reward coefficients α in Equation 1, and results are presented in Table 9. We report two metrics: crawler recall and crawler action. The crawler action refers to the total number of [Search] and [Expand] actions throughout the\n\nCrawler's entire trajectory. As the reward increases, both crawler recall and crawler action increase, suggesting that adjusting rewards in RL training can effectively influence PaSa's behavior.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduce PaSa, a novel paper search agent designed to provide comprehensive and accurate results for complex academic queries. PaSa is implemented within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents. To train PaSa, we developed AutoScholarQuery, a dataset of fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers drawn from top-tier AI conference publications. To evaluate PaSa in real-world scenarios, we also constructed RealScholarQuery, a dataset of actual academic queries paired with annotated papers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaSa outperforms all baselines, including Google, Google\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": "within the PaSa framework. It can perform multiple searches, paper reading, and citation network crawling.\n\nWe carefully designed prompts for all baselines and they are shown in Appendix E.1.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the crawling process of PaSa can be visualized as a paper tree. In practice, considering the computational expense, we limit the Crawler's exploration depth (starting from the user query) to three for both PaSa-7b and PaSaGPT-4o.\n\nFor Google-based baselines, we evaluate recall using Recall@20, Recall@50, and Recall@100 metrics for the top-20, top-50, and top-100 search results, respectively. For other baselines, we assess precision and recall for the final retrieved papers. Additionally, we compare the crawler's recall between PaSa-GPT-4o and PaSa-7b.\n\n5.3 Main results\n\nAs shown in Table 5, PaSa-7b outperforms all baselines on AutoScholarQuery test set. Specifically,\n\ncompared to the strongest baseline, PaSa-GPT-4o, PaSa-7b demonstrates a 9.64% improvement in recall with comparable precision. Moreover, the recall of the Crawler in PaSa-7b is 3.66% higher than that in PaSa-GPT-4o. When compared to the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa7b achieves an improvement of 33.80%, 38.83% and 42.64% in Recall@20, Recall@50 and Recall@100, respectively.\n\nWe observe that using multiple ensembles of Crawler during inference can improve performance. Specifically, running Crawler twice during inference increased the Crawler recall by 3.34% on AutoScholarQuery, leading to the final recall improvement by 1.51%, with precision remaining similar.\n\nTo evaluate PaSa in a more realistic setting, we assess its effectiveness on RealScholarQuery. As illustrated in Table 6, PaSa-7b exhibits a greater advantage in real-world academic search scenarios. Compared to PaSa-GPT-4o, PaSa-7b achieves improvements of 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. Against the best Google-based baseline on RealScholarQuery, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa7b outperforms Google by 37.78%, 39.90%, and 39.83% in recall@20, recall@50 and recall@100, respectively. Additionally, the PaSa-7b-ensemble further enhances crawler recall by 4.32%, contributing to an overall 3.52% improvement in the recall\n\nof the entire agent system.\n\nAs both the final decision-maker and auxiliary reward model in RL training for the Crawler, the performance of the Selector is crucial. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected a dataset of 200 query-paper pairs, annotating whether each paper meets the query's requirements. This dataset serves as the benchmark for evaluating the Selector (see Appendix C for details). We then compared our Selector against GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and Qwen-2.5-7b (Yang et al., 2024), as shown in Table 7. The results show that our Selector achieves an F1 score of 85%, outperforming GPT-4o by 5% and Qwen-2.5-7b by 30%. Additionally, when compared to a setting where reasoning precedes decision token generation, the performance is comparable. Lastly, the Selector's precision reaches 95%, confirming its effectiveness as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler RL training.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n5.4 Ablation study\n\nWe perform ablation studies in Table 8 to evaluate the individual contributions of exploring citation networks, RL training, and using the Selector as the reward model. The results indicate that removing the [Expand] action from the Crawler leads to a significant drop in the recall: a decrease of 22.98% on AutoScholarQuery and 32.21% on RealScholarQuery. Furthermore, RL training enhances recall by 6.24% on AutoScholarQuery and 19.96% on RealScholarQuery. The RL training curves are depicted in Figure 3, where the training curves show a steady increase in return with the training steps, eventually converging after 200 steps. Finally, removing the Selector as an auxiliary reward model results in a 3.76% recall drop on AutoScholarQuery and a 9.63% drop on RealScholarQuery.\n\nWe investigate how to control agent behavior by adjusting the rewards in RL training. Experiments are conducted with varying reward coefficients α in Equation 1, and results are presented in Table 9. We report two metrics: crawler recall and crawler action. The crawler action refers to the total number of [Search] and [Expand] actions throughout the\n\nCrawler's entire trajectory. As the reward increases, both crawler recall and crawler action increase, suggesting that adjusting rewards in RL training can effectively influence PaSa's behavior.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduce PaSa, a novel paper search agent designed to provide comprehensive and accurate results for complex academic queries. PaSa is implemented within the AGILE, a reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents. To train PaSa, we developed AutoScholarQuery, a dataset of fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers drawn from top-tier AI conference publications. To evaluate PaSa in real-world scenarios, we also constructed RealScholarQuery, a dataset of actual academic queries paired with annotated papers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaSa outperforms all baselines, including Google, Google"

To train PaSa, we developed AutoScholarQuery, a dataset of fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers drawn from top-tier AI conference publications. To evaluate PaSa in real-world scenarios, we also constructed RealScholarQuery, a dataset of actual academic queries paired with annotated papers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaSa outperforms all baselines, including Google, Google Scholar, and Google with GPT-4o, ChatGPT, GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o. In particular, PaSa-7B surpasses Google with GPT-4o by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50, while also exceeding PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.

There are two types of sessions: search session (starting from state S q ) and expand session (starting from state S q + p ).\n\nFor search sessions starting from S q , we sample user queries from the AutoScholarQuery training set and prompt GPT-4o to generate corresponding search queries. The prompt template is shown in Table 10. The session trajectory is constructed\n\nby adding a [Search] token before each query, concatenating the queries, and appending a [Stop] token at the end, as shown in Table 11. A total of 3,011 search session trajectories are generated.\n\nFor expand sessions starting from S q + p , we continue by searching for the generated queries using Google. We then sample papers from the search results and obtain the initial state, which includes both the query and a paper. To build the session trajectory, we examine each sub-section of the paper. If the sub-section references at least one paper in the AutoScholarQuery training set corresponding to the query, the sub-section is selected. Otherwise, the sub-section is selected with a 10% probability to enhance trajectory diversity. The selected sections are filled into the template in Table 11, completing the session trajectory. In total, 9,978 expand session trajectories are constructed.\n\nA.2 Roll-Out in PPO training\n\nDuring PPO training, each device processes 4 user queries in each step, generating a search session for each user query. Then, 6 expansion sessions are created by randomly sampling 6 papers from the search results. This process is repeated with the expand citation results, yielding 6 additional expand sessions. In total, 16 session trajectories are generated per step.\n\nB Implementation Details of the Selector\n\nWe begin by sampling user queries from the AutoScholarQuery training set. For each user query and one of its corresponding papers in the AutoScholarQuery training set, we prompt GPT-4o to generate a decision token and rationale (see Table 15 for prompt). We reject any data where the decision token is \"False\", as this contradicts the AutoScholarQuery label. The remaining data are retained as positive <user query, paper> pairs.\n\nNext, we simulate a partial paper search using PaSa-GPT-4o. In this simulation, each paper has a 50% probability of being added to the paper queue. Pairs where the paper is not selected by GPT-4o and is not in the AutoScholarQuery training set are labeled as negative examples.\n\nThe final training dataset consists of 19,812 <user query, paper> pairs, each with a decision token and rationale generated by GPT-4o, drawn from 9,000 instances in the AutoScholarQuery training set.\n\nC Selector Test Dataset\n\nWe select 200 queries from the AutoScholarQuery development set. For each query, we perform a Google search and randomly choose one paper from the union of the search results and the relevant paper set in AutoScholarQuery. This yields a set of <user query, paper> pairs. Annotators then evaluate whether each paper aligns with the requirements of the user query. The final test dataset consists of 98 positive samples and 102 negative samples.\n\nD Dataset Examples\n\nTable 12 shows the examples of queries and corresponding papers in RealScholarQuery.\n\nE Prompt Templates\n\nE.1 Prompts for Baselines\n\nTable 13 exhibits the search query paraphrasing prompt for the baseline model Google with GPT4o .\n\nTable 14 exhibits the prompt for the baseline model ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o).\n\nE.2 Prompt for Paper Selection\n\nTable 15 shows the prompt for PaSa selector and gpt-4o to judge whether a paper matches the requirements of the user's query.\n\nTable 16 presents the prompt template used with GPT-4o to automatically generate AutoScholarQuery. For each paper, we extract the Related Work section, input it into GPT-4o, and use the prompt to extract scholarly queries and their corresponding paper answers from the Related Work section.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\nQuery: Give me papers about how to rank search results by the use of LLM\n\nQuery Date:\n\n2024-10-01\n######################\nOutput:",

There are two types of sessions: search session (starting from state S q ) and expand session (starting from state S q + p ).\n\nFor search sessions starting from S q , we sample user queries from the AutoScholarQuery training set and prompt GPT-4o to generate corresponding search queries. The prompt template is shown in Table 10. The session trajectory is constructed\n\nby adding a [Search] token before each query, concatenating the queries, and appending a [Stop] token at the end, as shown in Table 11. A total of 3,011 search session trajectories are generated.\n\nFor expand sessions starting from S q + p , we continue by searching for the generated queries using Google. We then sample papers from the search results and obtain the initial state, which includes both the query and a paper. To build the session trajectory, we examine each sub-section of the paper. If the sub-section references at least one paper in the AutoScholarQuery training set corresponding to the query, the sub-section is selected. Otherwise, the sub-section is selected with a 10% probability to enhance trajectory diversity. The selected sections are filled into the template in Table 11, completing the session trajectory. In total, 9,978 expand session trajectories are constructed.\n\nA.2 Roll-Out in PPO training\n\nDuring PPO training, each device processes 4 user queries in each step, generating a search session for each user query. Then, 6 expansion sessions are created by randomly sampling 6 papers from the search results. This process is repeated with the expand citation results, yielding 6 additional expand sessions. In total, 16 session trajectories are generated per step.\n\nB Implementation Details of the Selector\n\nWe begin by sampling user queries from the AutoScholarQuery training set. For each user query and one of its corresponding papers in the AutoScholarQuery training set, we prompt GPT-4o to generate a decision token and rationale (see Table 15 for prompt). We reject any data where the decision token is \"False\", as this contradicts the AutoScholarQuery label. The remaining data are retained as positive <user query, paper> pairs.\n\nNext, we simulate a partial paper search using PaSa-GPT-4o. In this simulation, each paper has a 50% probability of being added to the paper queue. Pairs where the paper is not selected by GPT-4o and is not in the AutoScholarQuery training set are labeled as negative examples.\n\nThe final training dataset consists of 19,812 <user query, paper> pairs, each with a decision token and rationale generated by GPT-4o, drawn from 9,000 instances in the AutoScholarQuery training set.\n\nC Selector Test Dataset\n\nWe select 200 queries from the AutoScholarQuery development set. For each query, we perform a Google search and randomly choose one paper from the union of the search results and the relevant paper set in AutoScholarQuery. This yields a set of <user query, paper> pairs. Annotators then evaluate whether each paper aligns with the requirements of the user query. The final test dataset consists of 98 positive samples and 102 negative samples.\n\nD Dataset Examples\n\nTable 12 shows the examples of queries and corresponding papers in RealScholarQuery.\n\nE Prompt Templates\n\nE.1 Prompts for Baselines\n\nTable 13 exhibits the search query paraphrasing prompt for the baseline model Google with GPT4o .\n\nTable 14 exhibits the prompt for the baseline model ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o).\n\nE.2 Prompt for Paper Selection\n\nTable 15 shows the prompt for PaSa selector and gpt-4o to judge whether a paper matches the requirements of the user's query.\n\nTable 16 presents the prompt template used with GPT-4o to automatically generate AutoScholarQuery. For each paper, we extract the Related Work section, input it into GPT-4o, and use the prompt to extract scholarly queries and their corresponding paper answers from the Related Work section.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\nQuery: Give me papers about how to rank search results by the use of LLM\n\nQuery Date:\n\n2024-10-01"

Quantitative Results\n\nImage Generation Performances. We report the performances on GenEval, DPG-Bench and MJHQ FID-30k. In Tab. 2, we give comparisons on GenEval including the scores of all the sub-tasks and the overall score. JanusFlow achieves an overall score of 0.63, surpassing the previous unified framework and several generation specific models including SDXL [71] and DALL-E 2 [74]. In Tab. 3, We show results on DPG-Bench and the corresponding comparisons. It is noted that all the methods in Tab. 3 are generation-specific models except our model. The results on GenEval and DPGBench demonstrate the ability of instruction following of our model. We give the comparisons on MJHQ FID-30k in Tab. 4. The images which are sampled to calculate FID are generated with a CFG factor 𝑤 = 2 and a number of sampling steps 30. We sweep the CFG factor and the sampling steps\n\n<missing-text>\n\nand provide the results in the appendix. Our method achieves the best performance among all the models with 1.3B LLM. The results prove that the rectified flow is able to improve the quality of generated images over autoregressive models such as Janus [93].\n\nMultimodal Understanding Performances. We show comparisons of our method and other methods including understanding-specific models and unified understanding and generation models in Tab. 5. Our model reaches the best performances among all the models with similar number of parameters and even surpasses multiple understanding-specific methods with larger scales. Our results demonstrate that our method harmonizes autoregressive LLM and rectified flow, achieving satisfying performance in both understanding and generation.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n4.5. Ablation Studies\n\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. For computational efficiency, all ablation experiments are performed on 256 × 256 resolution images 2 . All models are trained on our unified pre-training dataset for 50, 000 iterations, except for the understanding-only and generation-only variants, which are trained for proportionally fewer iterations based on their respective data ratios in the pre-training phase. The quantitative results of these ablation studies are presented in Tab. 6.\n\nImpact of Representation Alignment. The comparison between Exp. A and F demonstrates the significant benefits of incorporating representation alignment regularization [99] during training. Specifically, models trained with representation alignment show notably lower FID scores on MJHQ dataset and higher CLIP scores, indicating simultaneous improvements in both image quality and semantic alignment. Importantly, our architecture differs from previous studies [65, 70] examined in [99] due to our incorporation of LLM and an additional skip connection between 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 . The effectiveness of representation alignment in our modified architecture suggests its broad applicability and generalization capability across different network structures.\n\nImpact of Decoupling Visual Encoders. e efficacy of using powerful pre-trained visual encoders\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\nBeautiful surreal symbolism the mesmerizing vision of a Cleopatra Queen of Egypt, mesmerizing brown eyes, black hair and ethereal features, radiating celestial aura, super high definition, true lifelike color, perfect exposure, razor sharp focus, golden ratio, soft reflections, bokeh effect, fine art photography, cinematic compositing, authentic, professional.\n\nA lone figure in dark robes ascends worn stone steps toward a glowing light in an ancient temple entrance. Ornate arches, lush greenery, and intricate carvings adorn the scene, evoking a mystical, high-fantasy atmosphere reminiscent of works by artists like Randy Vargas, with cinematic lighting and epic storytelling.\n\nin multimodal understanding. The comparison among Exp. B, C, and F demonstrates the advantages of using separate visual encoders for understanding and generation tasks. In Exp. B, following a design similar to Transfusion [103], we implement shared ConvNeXt blocks in the SDXL-VAE latent space for both understanding and generation encoders. Exp. C employs separate encoders with identical architectures and initialization parameters, but trained independently. The performance differences between these configurations validate the necessity of decoupled visual encoders in improving our unified model's capabilities. Moreover, the superior results in Exp. C and F highlight the benefits of leveraging pre-trained semantic visual encoders for multimodal understanding tasks.\n\nFair Comparison with Understanding / Generation-Only Models. To establish meaningful benchmarks, we evaluate task-specific models trained under identical conditions - using the same pre-training dataset, infrastructure, and hyperparameters. Exp. D and E represent these specialized models, trained with data volumes matching the unified models in Tab. 6. The minimal performance gap between Exp. F and these task-specific baselines demonstrates that our unified framework successfully integrates understanding and generation capabilities\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\nJaunsFlow (Ours): Kid's Favourite Fruits is a bar graph.

Quantitative Results\n\nImage Generation Performances. We report the performances on GenEval, DPG-Bench and MJHQ FID-30k. In Tab. 2, we give comparisons on GenEval including the scores of all the sub-tasks and the overall score. JanusFlow achieves an overall score of 0.63, surpassing the previous unified framework and several generation specific models including SDXL [71] and DALL-E 2 [74]. In Tab. 3, We show results on DPG-Bench and the corresponding comparisons. It is noted that all the methods in Tab. 3 are generation-specific models except our model. The results on GenEval and DPGBench demonstrate the ability of instruction following of our model. We give the comparisons on MJHQ FID-30k in Tab. 4. The images which are sampled to calculate FID are generated with a CFG factor 𝑤 = 2 and a number of sampling steps 30. We sweep the CFG factor and the sampling steps\n\n<missing-text>\n\nand provide the results in the appendix. Our method achieves the best performance among all the models with 1.3B LLM. The results prove that the rectified flow is able to improve the quality of generated images over autoregressive models such as Janus [93].\n\nMultimodal Understanding Performances. We show comparisons of our method and other methods including understanding-specific models and unified understanding and generation models in Tab. 5. Our model reaches the best performances among all the models with similar number of parameters and even surpasses multiple understanding-specific methods with larger scales. Our results demonstrate that our method harmonizes autoregressive LLM and rectified flow, achieving satisfying performance in both understanding and generation.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n4.5. Ablation Studies\n\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. For computational efficiency, all ablation experiments are performed on 256 × 256 resolution images 2 . All models are trained on our unified pre-training dataset for 50, 000 iterations, except for the understanding-only and generation-only variants, which are trained for proportionally fewer iterations based on their respective data ratios in the pre-training phase. The quantitative results of these ablation studies are presented in Tab. 6.\n\nImpact of Representation Alignment. The comparison between Exp. A and F demonstrates the significant benefits of incorporating representation alignment regularization [99] during training. Specifically, models trained with representation alignment show notably lower FID scores on MJHQ dataset and higher CLIP scores, indicating simultaneous improvements in both image quality and semantic alignment. Importantly, our architecture differs from previous studies [65, 70] examined in [99] due to our incorporation of LLM and an additional skip connection between 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 . The effectiveness of representation alignment in our modified architecture suggests its broad applicability and generalization capability across different network structures.\n\nImpact of Decoupling Visual Encoders. e efficacy of using powerful pre-trained visual encoders\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\nBeautiful surreal symbolism the mesmerizing vision of a Cleopatra Queen of Egypt, mesmerizing brown eyes, black hair and ethereal features, radiating celestial aura, super high definition, true lifelike color, perfect exposure, razor sharp focus, golden ratio, soft reflections, bokeh effect, fine art photography, cinematic compositing, authentic, professional.\n\nA lone figure in dark robes ascends worn stone steps toward a glowing light in an ancient temple entrance. Ornate arches, lush greenery, and intricate carvings adorn the scene, evoking a mystical, high-fantasy atmosphere reminiscent of works by artists like Randy Vargas, with cinematic lighting and epic storytelling.\n\nin multimodal understanding. The comparison among Exp. B, C, and F demonstrates the advantages of using separate visual encoders for understanding and generation tasks. In Exp. B, following a design similar to Transfusion [103], we implement shared ConvNeXt blocks in the SDXL-VAE latent space for both understanding and generation encoders. Exp. C employs separate encoders with identical architectures and initialization parameters, but trained independently. The performance differences between these configurations validate the necessity of decoupled visual encoders in improving our unified model's capabilities. Moreover, the superior results in Exp. C and F highlight the benefits of leveraging pre-trained semantic visual encoders for multimodal understanding tasks.\n\nFair Comparison with Understanding / Generation-Only Models. To establish meaningful benchmarks, we evaluate task-specific models trained under identical conditions - using the same pre-training dataset, infrastructure, and hyperparameters. Exp. D and E represent these specialized models, trained with data volumes matching the unified models in Tab. 6. The minimal performance gap between Exp. F and these task-specific baselines demonstrates that our unified framework successfully integrates understanding and generation capabilities\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\nJaunsFlow (Ours): Kid's Favourite Fruits is a bar graph.

Introduction\n\nRangelands can be defined in different ways (Sayre et al., 2017; Herrick et al., 2012). However, the definition given by Pratt et al. (1966), namely \"land carrying natural or semi-natural vegetation which provides a habitat suitable for herds of wild or domestic ungulates\", is good enough for the purposes of this paper. Rangelands contribute to the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people (between 0.7 and 2 billion according to Engler and von Wehrden (2018)), and provide ecosystem services such as forage, fresh water, medicinal products, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, hunting, traditional lifestyles, or tourist experiences  (Sala et al., 2017).  Estimates of the total global area of rangelands vary widely (Reid et al., 2014), not always due to differences in  its  definition.  Thus, for example, Asner et al. (2004) state that managed grazing occupies 25% of the global land surface whereas Engler et al. (2018) put this figure at 44.1%. In any case,  rangelands  are  the form of land use with the largest geographic extent (Ferner et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2014; Asner et al., 2004). Most of the world's grazing area (78%  according to Asner et al. (2004))  is in drylands, i.e. areas  where precipitation  is  typically  unpredictable  and  the  ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration  is  less than 0.65,  as defined by the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).\n\nRangelands are being  affected by several  global  drivers  of change, namely  climate change,  the increasing demand for food and renewable  energy,  technological change and  the mobility of global capital.  Climate change is expected to cause a decrease in precipitation, and increases in potential evapotranspiration, the variability of rainfall and the frequency  and  duration  of  droughts  in  most  rangelands.  Thus,  climate  change  would aggravate the aridity of these areas worldwide (Reid et al., 2014; Maestre et al., 2012).\n\nThe increasing demand for livestock products, which is  caused by a  growing human population and by a shift in diets, especially in the developing world, pushes the prices of animal products up  (Reid et al., 2014;  FAO, 2012).  The increasing demand for cereals, fibre and renewable energy, along with technological change and the mobility of  global capital,  are already  causing  a \"revolutionary\" conversion  of rangelands to\n\nother land uses, especially crop production (Reid et al., 2014; Herrick et al., 2012).\n\nIt  is difficult to assess  the likely social and environmental  impacts  of these global drivers  on rangelands. Higher prices of animal products would increase the generally low  incomes  of farmers  and pastoralists.

Higher prices of animal products would increase the generally low  incomes  of farmers  and pastoralists. But greater aridity would  have the contrary\n\neffect,  because  it  would  reduce  the  amount  of  grazing  resources  and  make  their provision more uncertain. The outcome of these opposite forces will likely determine the extent to which people, especially young people, continue leaving rangelands (Reid et al., 2014),  and  the rate of conversion  to other land uses.  Producers  with higher incomes  would  be  encouraged  to  intensify  production,  particularly  by  increasing livestock  numbers  and  by  supplementary  feeding  (Reid  et  al.,  2014).  What environmental impacts would such intensification have on rangelands? Many authors state that it would increase the risk of land degradation (Engler et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2016; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Vetter, 2005; Illius and O'Connor, 1999), but others disagree (Sullivan and Rohde, 2002; Perevolotski and Seligman, 1998). In any case, defining degradation in a variable system is challenging (Gillson and Hoffman, 2007), and highly subjective (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Reynolds and Stafford Smith, 2002; Perevolotski and Seligman, 1998). On the other hand, the possibility of changing the land use offers new opportunities to rangeland inhabitants and prospects of significant short-term economic benefits, but the environmental effects of such a conversion could be  catastrophic  if it is carried out in lands  that  are susceptible to  losing soil through erosion (Herrick et al., 2012).\n\nClearly,  the  impacts  of  global  drivers  on  rangelands  will  depend  on  what  are  the characteristics of the land, the temporal and  spatial scales, and the groups  of interest considered (Reynolds and Stafford Smith, 2002). Thus, the question arises whether it is possible to gain general insights into such impacts. In this paper, we present a study that seems to give an affirmative answer to this question, and which was based on the following three premises:\n\n i. System sensitivities hold crucial clues. For example, one of our estimates is that soil erosion is around eight hundred times more sensitive to an increase in rainfall variability than to an increase, by the same percent, in the world/regional price of meat (Section 3). Hence, climate change would pose a much greater environmental threat to rangelands than  the  growing  demand  for  animal  products  (with  the  corresponding  increase  in livestock numbers).\n\n ii.  Simulation  models  are  needed.  Estimating  system  sensitivities  by  performing statistical  methods on data collected from a representative sample of sites pose major problems. Indeed, an enormous amount of data is required to take account of the many ecological  and  socio-economic  factors  involved,  their  relationships  and  variability;\n\nmuch of these data are unavailable, especially social and economic data; and, after all, global drivers could result in changes that were not observed in the past (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Oomen et al., 2016; Tietjen and Jeltsch, 2007; Williams and Albertson, 2006; Vetter, 2005).\n\niii. An integrated  multidisciplinary  approach  is needed. This has been, and still is, widely advocated in the rangeland literature (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Ferner et al., 2018; Berrouet et al., 2018;  Herrero and Thornton, 2013;  Maestre et al., 2012; Herrick et al., 2012; Dougill et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2007; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Gillson  and  Hoffman,  2007; Vetter, S., 2005).  However,  integrated  studies  are rare, mainly because of a lack of communication across disciplines (Vetter, S., 2005). Integration means to take account of the key exogenous and endogenous factors in a rangeland system, and their relationships. An exogenous factor, i.e. a driver in the sense given here, in accordance with Stafford Smith et al. (2007), influences the rangeland but is  not, or is hardly,  influenced  by  it;  an  endogenous factor is  influenced  by other endogenous factors and, possibly, by some of the exogenous ones. It follows from these definitions  that  the stocking rate is never a driver,  but  an endogenous factor whose determinants  could  differ between  rangeland systems.  Thus,  at least in commercial rangelands,  which  would  currently  amount  to  45.5%  of  the  total  global  area  of rangelands (Engler et al., 2018\n######################\nOutput:",

But greater aridity would  have the contrary\n\neffect,  because  it  would  reduce  the  amount  of  grazing  resources  and  make  their provision more uncertain. The outcome of these opposite forces will likely determine the extent to which people, especially young people, continue leaving rangelands (Reid et al., 2014),  and  the rate of conversion  to other land uses.  Producers  with higher incomes  would  be  encouraged  to  intensify  production,  particularly  by  increasing livestock  numbers  and  by  supplementary  feeding  (Reid  et  al.,  2014).  What environmental impacts would such intensification have on rangelands? Many authors state that it would increase the risk of land degradation (Engler et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2016; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Vetter, 2005; Illius and O'Connor, 1999), but others disagree (Sullivan and Rohde, 2002; Perevolotski and Seligman, 1998). In any case, defining degradation in a variable system is challenging (Gillson and Hoffman, 2007), and highly subjective (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Reynolds and Stafford Smith, 2002; Perevolotski and Seligman, 1998). On the other hand, the possibility of changing the land use offers new opportunities to rangeland inhabitants and prospects of significant short-term economic benefits, but the environmental effects of such a conversion could be  catastrophic  if it is carried out in lands  that  are susceptible to  losing soil through erosion (Herrick et al., 2012).\n\nClearly,  the  impacts  of  global  drivers  on  rangelands  will  depend  on  what  are  the characteristics of the land, the temporal and  spatial scales, and the groups  of interest considered (Reynolds and Stafford Smith, 2002). Thus, the question arises whether it is possible to gain general insights into such impacts. In this paper, we present a study that seems to give an affirmative answer to this question, and which was based on the following three premises:\n\n i. System sensitivities hold crucial clues. For example, one of our estimates is that soil erosion is around eight hundred times more sensitive to an increase in rainfall variability than to an increase, by the same percent, in the world/regional price of meat (Section 3). Hence, climate change would pose a much greater environmental threat to rangelands than  the  growing  demand  for  animal  products  (with  the  corresponding  increase  in livestock numbers).\n\n ii.  Simulation  models  are  needed.  Estimating  system  sensitivities  by  performing statistical  methods on data collected from a representative sample of sites pose major problems. Indeed, an enormous amount of data is required to take account of the many ecological  and  socio-economic  factors  involved,  their  relationships  and  variability;\n\nmuch of these data are unavailable, especially social and economic data; and, after all, global drivers could result in changes that were not observed in the past (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Oomen et al., 2016; Tietjen and Jeltsch, 2007; Williams and Albertson, 2006; Vetter, 2005).\n\niii. An integrated  multidisciplinary  approach  is needed. This has been, and still is, widely advocated in the rangeland literature (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Ferner et al., 2018; Berrouet et al., 2018;  Herrero and Thornton, 2013;  Maestre et al., 2012; Herrick et al., 2012; Dougill et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2007; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Gillson  and  Hoffman,  2007; Vetter, S., 2005).  However,  integrated  studies  are rare, mainly because of a lack of communication across disciplines (Vetter, S., 2005). Integration means to take account of the key exogenous and endogenous factors in a rangeland system, and their relationships. An exogenous factor, i.e. a driver in the sense given here, in accordance with Stafford Smith et al. (2007), influences the rangeland but is  not, or is hardly,  influenced  by  it;  an  endogenous factor is  influenced  by other endogenous factors and, possibly, by some of the exogenous ones. It follows from these definitions  that  the stocking rate is never a driver,  but  an endogenous factor whose determinants  could  differ between  rangeland systems.  Thus,  at least in commercial rangelands,  which  would  currently  amount  to  45.5%  of  the  total  global  area  of rangelands (Engler et al., 2018"

It follows from these definitions  that  the stocking rate is never a driver,  but  an endogenous factor whose determinants  could  differ between  rangeland systems.  Thus,  at least in commercial rangelands,  which  would  currently  amount  to  45.5%  of  the  total  global  area  of rangelands (Engler et al., 2018), but which are undergoing major expansion (Sayre et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2014; Dougill et al., 2010; Vetter, 2005; Ellis and Swift, 1988), diverse economic, managerial and climatic factors interact to determine stocking rates. Among the economic and managerial factors there are drivers such as world/regional prices, and the advent of technologies,  production systems,  or  policy  environments (Stafford Smith et al.,  2007);  and  endogenous factors such as local prices, density of farmers/pastoralists, their economic character, i.e. conservative or opportunistic, level of inputs,  or  profits.  Hence,  at  least  in  commercial  rangelands,  an  integrated  socioenvironmental impact assessment should lead to comparisons of the sensitivities of key endogenous factors (including stocking rates) to diverse drivers, similar to that given to illustrate our first premise. However, notable exceptions notwithstanding, e.g. Dougill et al. (2010), there is a lack of such a kind of assessments. As we will see, a side effect of this deficiency might be that the undeniable potential for livestock to impact rangelands may receive undue emphasis.\n\nIn sum, this paper presents a study aimed at assessing, by means of an integrated model, the sensitivities of key endogenous factors in private commercial farms, i.e. number of\n\nactive farmers, profits, stocking rate, standing herbage biomass, and soil erosion, to 70 biophysical,  economic  and  behavioural  factors,  including  specific  characteristics  of global drivers of change, e.g. level of and variability in world/regional prices, depth of and variability in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, or severity and return period of droughts. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides outlines of the model and  the assessment procedure. Results are presented in Section 3,  and discussed  in Section 4.  Finally, the main conclusions drawn from the study are summarized  in Section  5.  Because  of  space  constraints,  a  detailed  description  of  the  model,  the complete  list of model  parameters, and details about the assessment procedure  are provided in a Supplementary Document.\n\n2. Material and methods\n\n2.1. Outline of the model\n\nThe model represents a commercial farming area, its farmers, the main local markets on which they trade, and key ecosystem services involved. Climate is characterised by the alternation  of  dry  and  wet  seasons  as  well  as  the  regular  occurrence  of  droughts. Herbage mass is made up  only of annual species  (woody vegetation is periodically removed  by  ploughing  or  fire).  Farms  are  extensive  private  farms  which  produce weaned animals for sale (hereafter, the output), and farmers normally buy and provide supplementary feed for livestock. Herd/flock sizes are mostly changed by trading with breeding  females  (young  females  only  replace  old  females  that  leave  production). Farmers receive subsidies which do not depend on stocking rates.\n\nAlthough  this  is not  an unreal  grazing  system,  it would be difficult to estimate the fraction of the global area of rangelands that could be characterized in a similar way. Nevertheless,  two  reasons  make  this system  interesting for our assessment. First, it represents  the  final stages  of some ongoing  transformations  in rangelands.  Indeed,  as already indicated, there is a trend worldwide towards converting communal rangelands into extensive private farms (see references above), and the intensification of livestock production favours a replacement of perennial grasses by annuals (Tarrasón et al., 2016; Stafford  Smith  et  al.,  2007;  Vetter,  2005;  Illius  and  O'Connor,  1999;  Milton  and Siegfried, 1994). And second, annual grasslands where livestock mobility is limited and animals are supplemented are considered to be grazing systems with the highest risks of\n\ndegradation (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Engler et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2016; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Vetter, 2005; Illius and O'Connor, 1999).\n\n<missing-text>\n\n Costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females\n\nThe model comprises 107 equations which result from the integration and upgrading of models  that have already been presented and utilized in previous papers (Ibáñez and Martínez-Valderrama,  2018;  Ibañez  et  al.,  2016;  Ibañez  et  al.,  2014a).  The  model follows the system dynamics approach (e.g. Elsawah et al., 2017), and is lumped spatial (Kelly et al., 2013).  Therefore,  its equations are mostly nonlinear\n######################\nOutput:",

        "text": ", possibly, by some of the exogenous ones. It follows from these definitions  that  the stocking rate is never a driver,  but  an endogenous factor whose determinants  could  differ between  rangeland systems.  Thus,  at least in commercial rangelands,  which  would  currently  amount  to  45.5%  of  the  total  global  area  of rangelands (Engler et al., 2018), but which are undergoing major expansion (Sayre et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2014; Dougill et al., 2010; Vetter, 2005; Ellis and Swift, 1988), diverse economic, managerial and climatic factors interact to determine stocking rates. Among the economic and managerial factors there are drivers such as world/regional prices, and the advent of technologies,  production systems,  or  policy  environments (Stafford Smith et al.,  2007);  and  endogenous factors such as local prices, density of farmers/pastoralists, their economic character, i.e. conservative or opportunistic, level of inputs,  or  profits.  Hence,  at  least  in  commercial  rangelands,  an  integrated  socioenvironmental impact assessment should lead to comparisons of the sensitivities of key endogenous factors (including stocking rates) to diverse drivers, similar to that given to illustrate our first premise. However, notable exceptions notwithstanding, e.g. Dougill et al. (2010), there is a lack of such a kind of assessments. As we will see, a side effect of this deficiency might be that the undeniable potential for livestock to impact rangelands may receive undue emphasis.\n\nIn sum, this paper presents a study aimed at assessing, by means of an integrated model, the sensitivities of key endogenous factors in private commercial farms, i.e. number of\n\nactive farmers, profits, stocking rate, standing herbage biomass, and soil erosion, to 70 biophysical,  economic  and  behavioural  factors,  including  specific  characteristics  of global drivers of change, e.g. level of and variability in world/regional prices, depth of and variability in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, or severity and return period of droughts. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides outlines of the model and  the assessment procedure. Results are presented in Section 3,  and discussed  in Section 4.  Finally, the main conclusions drawn from the study are summarized  in Section  5.  Because  of  space  constraints,  a  detailed  description  of  the  model,  the complete  list of model  parameters, and details about the assessment procedure  are provided in a Supplementary Document.\n\n2. Material and methods\n\n2.1. Outline of the model\n\nThe model represents a commercial farming area, its farmers, the main local markets on which they trade, and key ecosystem services involved. Climate is characterised by the alternation  of  dry  and  wet  seasons  as  well  as  the  regular  occurrence  of  droughts. Herbage mass is made up  only of annual species  (woody vegetation is periodically removed  by  ploughing  or  fire).  Farms  are  extensive  private  farms  which  produce weaned animals for sale (hereafter, the output), and farmers normally buy and provide supplementary feed for livestock. Herd/flock sizes are mostly changed by trading with breeding  females  (young  females  only  replace  old  females  that  leave  production). Farmers receive subsidies which do not depend on stocking rates.\n\nAlthough  this  is not  an unreal  grazing  system,  it would be difficult to estimate the fraction of the global area of rangelands that could be characterized in a similar way. Nevertheless,  two  reasons  make  this system  interesting for our assessment. First, it represents  the  final stages  of some ongoing  transformations  in rangelands.  Indeed,  as already indicated, there is a trend worldwide towards converting communal rangelands into extensive private farms (see references above), and the intensification of livestock production favours a replacement of perennial grasses by annuals (Tarrasón et al., 2016; Stafford  Smith  et  al.,  2007;  Vetter,  2005;  Illius  and  O'Connor,  1999;  Milton  and Siegfried, 1994). And second, annual grasslands where livestock mobility is limited and animals are supplemented are considered to be grazing systems with the highest risks of\n\ndegradation (Engler and von Wehrden, 2018; Engler et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2016; von Wehrden et al., 2012; Stafford Smith et al., 2007; Vetter, 2005; Illius and O'Connor, 1999).\n\n<missing-text>\n\n Costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females\n\nThe model comprises 107 equations which result from the integration and upgrading of models  that have already been presented and utilized in previous papers (Ibáñez and Martínez-Valderrama,  2018;  Ibañez  et  al.,  2016;  Ibañez  et  al.,  2014a).  The  model follows the system dynamics approach (e.g. Elsawah et al., 2017), and is lumped spatial (Kelly et al., 2013).  Therefore,  its equations are mostly nonlinear"

The  model follows the system dynamics approach (e.g. Elsawah et al., 2017), and is lumped spatial (Kelly et al., 2013).  Therefore,  its equations are mostly nonlinear and organized as multiple feedback loops, and the modelled variables are either totals or averages across a certain area, which differ between submodels (see Fig. 1 and below). The model output  consists  of  the  time  trajectories  of  every  endogenous  variable  over  a predetermined simulation period, and the input is a set of parameter values (Fig. 1). There are 87 biophysical, technical, economic and behavioural parameters, including 11\n\ninitial values of stock variables. All of them have real-world counterparts except six calibration parameters (see Table SD1 in the Supplementary Document). Parameters are divided into two groups (Fig. 1):\n\n i.  System  parameters,  which  are  exclusively  involved  in  the  socio-economic  and environmental submodels, and whose purpose is to specify the characteristics of the modelled system for a given simulation, i.e. the total area, the potential number of farmers  (or  farms),  livestock  characteristics  and  needs,  herbage  properties,  soil properties, hill-slope length and gradient, subsidies, default sizes of local markets, and average  responsiveness  of  farmers  and  traders,  i.e.  the  degree  at  which  they  are conservative  or  opportunistic,  on  average.  Besides,  system  parameters  calibrate functional relationships for a given simulation, with each preserving the general nonlinear shape (sigmoid, exponential, etc.) that ensures its outcome is not unrealistic even for extreme values of the explanatory variables, and thus model's internal consistency.\n\n ii.  Driver  parameters,  which  are  exclusively  involved  in  the  driver  submodel  (see below).\n\nModel equations are divided into three submodels (Fig. 1):\n\ni.  The  driver  submodel  generates  the  values  of  model  drivers  at  every  time  step. Weather drivers, i.e. rainfall depth, rainfall energy and reference evapotranspiration, are modelled to follow  more or less complex random patterns by combining sine wave functions,  whose  driver  parameters  are  amplitudes  and  periods,  with  random distributions, whose driver  parameters are means and standard deviations.  Economic drivers, i.e.  word/regional prices, costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females  (hereafter,  'other  costs')  and  opportunity  costs  of  farmers,  are  modelled  to follow interannual cycles by means of sine wave functions. By way of illustration, the generation of  rainfall depth during a  time step  is as follows. Whether it rains or not during a given time step (equal to 0.0078125 years, or around 2.85 days) is the outcome of a Bernoulli random variable in which  the 'yes' probability follows seasonal and interannual cycles formulated by means of sine wave functions and specified by means of  driver  parameters  (including the severity and return period of droughts). Then, in case that it rains during the  time step,  rainfall depth is sampled from a log-normal\n\n distribution. This set of equations is a substantial improvement on previous versions.\n\n ii.  The  socio-economic  submodel  refers to  the whole farming area. It comprises the following  endogenous variables and relationships involving  system  parameters  which are not detailed here for the sake of brevity: a) Total number of active farmers (or active\n\nfarms), which are related to profits and opportunity costs; b) Supplies of output and old females, which are related to the  total  number of breeding females  and  amounts of herbage  mass  and  supplementary  feed  available  for  livestock;  c)  Demand  for supplementary feed, which  is  related to the number of animals to be supplemented, availability of herbage, profits and  local  price of this input;  d)  External and internal supplies of,  and demands for,  breeding females, which are related to the number of active farmers, and their entry and exit, profits and local price of breeding females; e) Local prices of output, old animals, supplementary feed, and breeding females, which are related to world/regional prices,  supplies/demands  from the rangeland, temporary stocks  of unsold/undelivered products/inputs, and external  demands/supplies, whose behaviour depend on local prices themselves; f) Total profits in the farming area and profits for an average farmer, which are related to the selling of products, the purchasing of  inputs,  'other costs', local  prices  and  subsidies;  and  g)  Total  number  of  grazing animals  (breeding  and  young  females),  which  are  related  to  the  number  of  active farmers, profits, and price of breeding females. The average stocking rate results from dividing the total number of grazing animals by the area of active farms.\n\niii.

The  model follows the system dynamics approach (e.g. Elsawah et al., 2017), and is lumped spatial (Kelly et al., 2013).  Therefore,  its equations are mostly nonlinear and organized as multiple feedback loops, and the modelled variables are either totals or averages across a certain area, which differ between submodels (see Fig. 1 and below). The model output  consists  of  the  time  trajectories  of  every  endogenous  variable  over  a predetermined simulation period, and the input is a set of parameter values (Fig. 1). There are 87 biophysical, technical, economic and behavioural parameters, including 11\n\ninitial values of stock variables. All of them have real-world counterparts except six calibration parameters (see Table SD1 in the Supplementary Document). Parameters are divided into two groups (Fig. 1):\n\n i.  System  parameters,  which  are  exclusively  involved  in  the  socio-economic  and environmental submodels, and whose purpose is to specify the characteristics of the modelled system for a given simulation, i.e. the total area, the potential number of farmers  (or  farms),  livestock  characteristics  and  needs,  herbage  properties,  soil properties, hill-slope length and gradient, subsidies, default sizes of local markets, and average  responsiveness  of  farmers  and  traders,  i.e.  the  degree  at  which  they  are conservative  or  opportunistic,  on  average.  Besides,  system  parameters  calibrate functional relationships for a given simulation, with each preserving the general nonlinear shape (sigmoid, exponential, etc.) that ensures its outcome is not unrealistic even for extreme values of the explanatory variables, and thus model's internal consistency.\n\n ii.  Driver  parameters,  which  are  exclusively  involved  in  the  driver  submodel  (see below).\n\nModel equations are divided into three submodels (Fig. 1):\n\ni.  The  driver  submodel  generates  the  values  of  model  drivers  at  every  time  step. Weather drivers, i.e. rainfall depth, rainfall energy and reference evapotranspiration, are modelled to follow  more or less complex random patterns by combining sine wave functions,  whose  driver  parameters  are  amplitudes  and  periods,  with  random distributions, whose driver  parameters are means and standard deviations.  Economic drivers, i.e.  word/regional prices, costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females  (hereafter,  'other  costs')  and  opportunity  costs  of  farmers,  are  modelled  to follow interannual cycles by means of sine wave functions. By way of illustration, the generation of  rainfall depth during a  time step  is as follows. Whether it rains or not during a given time step (equal to 0.0078125 years, or around 2.85 days) is the outcome of a Bernoulli random variable in which  the 'yes' probability follows seasonal and interannual cycles formulated by means of sine wave functions and specified by means of  driver  parameters  (including the severity and return period of droughts). Then, in case that it rains during the  time step,  rainfall depth is sampled from a log-normal\n\n distribution. This set of equations is a substantial improvement on previous versions.\n\n ii.  The  socio-economic  submodel  refers to  the whole farming area. It comprises the following  endogenous variables and relationships involving  system  parameters  which are not detailed here for the sake of brevity: a) Total number of active farmers (or active\n\nfarms), which are related to profits and opportunity costs; b) Supplies of output and old females, which are related to the  total  number of breeding females  and  amounts of herbage  mass  and  supplementary  feed  available  for  livestock;  c)  Demand  for supplementary feed, which  is  related to the number of animals to be supplemented, availability of herbage, profits and  local  price of this input;  d)  External and internal supplies of,  and demands for,  breeding females, which are related to the number of active farmers, and their entry and exit, profits and local price of breeding females; e) Local prices of output, old animals, supplementary feed, and breeding females, which are related to world/regional prices,  supplies/demands  from the rangeland, temporary stocks  of unsold/undelivered products/inputs, and external  demands/supplies, whose behaviour depend on local prices themselves; f) Total profits in the farming area and profits for an average farmer, which are related to the selling of products, the purchasing of  inputs,  'other costs', local  prices  and  subsidies;  and  g)  Total  number  of  grazing animals  (breeding  and  young  females),  which  are  related  to  the  number  of  active farmers, profits, and price of breeding females. The average stocking rate results from dividing the total number of grazing animals by the area of active farms.\n\niii.

The  environmental  submodel  refers to a representative hectare within the farming area. It comprises the following endogenous variables and relationships  (again, the involved system parameters are not detailed here): a) Soil moisture, which depends on rainfall, evapotranspiration, soil drainage and surface runoff; b) Remaining soil depth, which depends on the weathering rate of the parent rock but mainly on the erosion rate; and c) Green and dry herbage masses, which depend on soil moisture and stocking rate. The  erosion rate  is related to  surface runoff and to  the remaining soil depth itself, because bulk density increases as soil is lost. Surface runoff is related to rainfall depth, rainfall  energy,  soil moisture and  canopy cover.  Livestock reduce canopy cover  by consuming herbage and by creating bare soil areas.\n\nThe  socio-economic  submodel  takes  the  availability  of  herbage  calculated  by  the environmental  submodel  as  the average availability across the farming  area  (Fig. 1). Similarly, the average stocking rate across the farming area calculated by the socioeconomic submodel is the stocking rate used in the environmental submodel (Fig. 1).\n\n2.2. Outline of the assessment procedure\n\nThe estimation of system sensitivities was carried out by means of a sensitivity analysis (SA) of the model. This analysis followed a global variance-based method (Gan et al., 2014; Saltelli et al., 2008). The term 'global' indicates that the effect of each parameter Xi  (i  =  1,  ...,  k)  on  a  target  (endogenous)  variable  Y  is  evaluated  by  varying  all parameters in each simulation of the analysis, thereby leading to robust estimates (in contrast to varying one parameter at a time). The term 'variance-based' indicates that the variance of each target variable, V(Y), is decomposed into terms corresponding to the different parameters and their interactions. These terms are commonly summarized by means of two indices: the first order sensitivity index (Si), which measures the firstorder effect of Xi,  i.e.  the expected reduction in V(Y) if Xi  was fixed; and the total sensitivity  index  (STi),  which  measures  the  total  contribution  to  V(Y)  due  to  Xi, including its first-order effect plus all higher-order effects due to interactions. Clearly, the latter index was especially suitable for our assessment. Given that both indices are always positive, they do not show whether a given effect is positive or negative. When needed, this detail was checked by plotting Y against Xi. As estimators of Si and STi (though estimates of the former were dismissed), we used those labelled as B3 by Glen and Isaacs (2012), authors who contrasted the accuracy of 12 pairs of estimators. B3 estimators require simulating the model N(k+2) times, where N is fixed by the user, k is the number of parameters, and 2N is the number of basic scenarios. A basic scenario is a complete  set  of  parameter  values  (one  model  input)  obtained  by  randomly  and independently  sampling a value for each  parameter within a predetermined  range of variation. To this end, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling. The other kN scenarios were obtained by combining the basic scenarios in the way explained by Glen and Isaacs. In our case, N was equalled to 4000, value at which the estimates of the main sensitivities achieved a satisfactory convergence. A 300-year simulation period was used in order to estimate long-term sensitivities.\n\nWe  evaluated the sensitivities of five target variables to 70 model parameters. The resting  17  parameters  were  excluded  for  different  reasons  (see  the  Supplementary Document for details). The target variables were the remaining soil depth at the end of the simulation period [mm], and four averages calculated over the entire simulation period, namely those of the  number of active farmers [frm],  average stocking rate (across  the  farming  area)  [LU/ha],  average  standing  herbage  biomass  (across  the farming area) [kg DM·ha -1 ], and annual earnings per active farmer [€·frm -1 ·yr -1 ] (see the Supplementary Document for details on this variable).  All these variables are 'slow'\n\nvariables,  which  are  useful  indicators  for  gaining  insights  into  long-term  changes (Reynolds et al., 2007). The SA utilized 288,000 model runs, i.e. N(k+2) where N = 4000 and k = 70. This means that system sensitivities were estimated by analysing the behaviours  of 288,000 variants of the modelled system during 300 years (each one corresponding to a different set of values of the system parameters) under the same number of different external conditions (each one generated on the basis of a different set of values of the driver parameters). Clearly, the power of an analysis like this can only be achieved by means of a simulation model. Note also that running the model under such a large number of scenarios without a single collapse is a strong test of model's internal consistency.\n\nA final point to be stressed is that the estimated sensitivities are normalized, i.e. refer to the  same  percentage  variation\n######################\nOutput:",

Specifically,  each  parameter was randomly sampled within a range equal to ± 30% of a default value. Most of the default values were derived from data on Spanish dehesas, which are commercial rangelands of the  northern Mediterranean region (see the Supplementary Document for details). By setting a wide range around every default  value, i.e. by  covering a  great diversity of variants of the modelled system, we intended to make findings that could be generalized beyond our case study, an issue which is discussed in Section 4.\n\n3. Results\n\nTable  1  presents the estimates of STi  for the 20  most important parameters affecting each target variable  of the SA. Regarding these results, we highlight the following points:\n\n i. Socio-economic target variables, i.e. number of active farmers, profits, and stocking rate, were almost exclusively sensitive to socio-economic factors, though they were scarcely  sensitive  to  the  price  of  supplementary  feed.  Hence,  the  socio-economic component  of  private  farming  systems  would  be  relatively  invulnerable  to  climate change.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n1 World/regional output price; 2 Costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females; 3 Opportunity cost; 4 Bulk density; 5 World/regional supplementary feed price; 6 Delay time for traders to adjust ...; 7 Delay time for farmers to adjust ...; 8 Time step; 9 Green herbage; 10 Standard deviation; 11 Dry herbage; 12 Soil water content; 13 Dry and bare soil; 14 Coefficient of variation.\n\n ii. Number of active farmers and profits were mostly sensitive to the same three factors in  the  same  order,  namely  level  of  the  world/regional  price  of  output  (positive relationship), target output per breeding female (positive relationship), and 'other costs' (negative relationship). Subsidies had a much lower effect on both target variables. Hence, unless 'other costs'  increase very considerably, it is likely  that the growing demand  for  animal  products  and  the  corresponding  intensification  of  livestock production  will  economically  benefit  farmers,  and  will  favour  their  permanence  in private farming systems. As stated in point (i), this would be so regardless of climate change. In consequence, it could be taken into consideration the possibility of reducing the level of subsidy.\n\niii. The stocking rate was mostly sensitive to the same three factors mentioned in (ii), showing the same type of relationships (positive/negative). Hence, again, unless 'other costs' increase significantly, it is likely  that the growing demand for animal products and the corresponding intensification of livestock production will increase livestock numbers in private farming systems.\n\n iv.  Environmental target variables, i.e. standing herbage biomass and remaining soil depth, were almost exclusively sensitive to biophysical factors. Hence, it is unlikely that the  growing  demand  for  animal  products  and  the  corresponding  intensification  of livestock production will impact on forage supply and soil erosion in private farming systems.\n\n v. Environmental target variables were especially sensitive to two parameters: 'initial topsoil porosity' and 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow' (abbreviated as 'BD  threshold  herbage'  in  Table  1).  These  parameters  were  practically  the  only biophysical parameters whose effects on the socio-economic target variables, though relatively unimportant, ranked among the top 20 effect list. The importance of both parameters is explained as follows. Given that the parametric scenarios used in the SA were ultimately based on random sampling, in some simulations (specifically, in 83,679 simulations), the value of 'initial topsoil porosity' entailed an initial topsoil bulk density which, by chance, exceeded the value of 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow'.  Therefore,  in  the  variants  of  the  modelled  system  corresponding  to  these simulations, the soil was entirely denuded of herbage cover from the very beginning. Moreover, it is likely that, in some other simulations (variants), the value of 'initial topsoil porosity' meant that topsoil bulk density was initially below the threshold but sufficiently close to it for the disappearance of herbage mass to happen within the\n\nsimulation period (recall from Section 2.1 that topsoil bulk density increases as soil is eroded). Hence, the combined effect of the parameters in question can be interpreted as the effect of a shortage of herbage mass. As a corollary, it is likely that shortages of herbage mass caused by a decrease in precipitation will seriously affect soil masses in private farming systems, though will leave their socio-economic components relatively unaffected.\n\nvi. Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), standing herbage biomass was mostly  sensitive  to  'average  rainfall  depth  per  time  step'  (positive  relationship), 'average reference evapotranspiration depth per time step' (negative relationship) and 'average  probability  of  rainfall  during  one  time  step'  (positive\n######################\nOutput:",

Hence,  the  socio-economic component  of  private  farming  systems  would  be  relatively  invulnerable  to  climate change.\n\n<missing-text>\n\n1 World/regional output price; 2 Costs other than supplementary feed and breeding females; 3 Opportunity cost; 4 Bulk density; 5 World/regional supplementary feed price; 6 Delay time for traders to adjust ...; 7 Delay time for farmers to adjust ...; 8 Time step; 9 Green herbage; 10 Standard deviation; 11 Dry herbage; 12 Soil water content; 13 Dry and bare soil; 14 Coefficient of variation.\n\n ii. Number of active farmers and profits were mostly sensitive to the same three factors in  the  same  order,  namely  level  of  the  world/regional  price  of  output  (positive relationship), target output per breeding female (positive relationship), and 'other costs' (negative relationship). Subsidies had a much lower effect on both target variables. Hence, unless 'other costs'  increase very considerably, it is likely  that the growing demand  for  animal  products  and  the  corresponding  intensification  of  livestock production  will  economically  benefit  farmers,  and  will  favour  their  permanence  in private farming systems. As stated in point (i), this would be so regardless of climate change. In consequence, it could be taken into consideration the possibility of reducing the level of subsidy.\n\niii. The stocking rate was mostly sensitive to the same three factors mentioned in (ii), showing the same type of relationships (positive/negative). Hence, again, unless 'other costs' increase significantly, it is likely  that the growing demand for animal products and the corresponding intensification of livestock production will increase livestock numbers in private farming systems.\n\n iv.  Environmental target variables, i.e. standing herbage biomass and remaining soil depth, were almost exclusively sensitive to biophysical factors. Hence, it is unlikely that the  growing  demand  for  animal  products  and  the  corresponding  intensification  of livestock production will impact on forage supply and soil erosion in private farming systems.\n\n v. Environmental target variables were especially sensitive to two parameters: 'initial topsoil porosity' and 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow' (abbreviated as 'BD  threshold  herbage'  in  Table  1).  These  parameters  were  practically  the  only biophysical parameters whose effects on the socio-economic target variables, though relatively unimportant, ranked among the top 20 effect list. The importance of both parameters is explained as follows. Given that the parametric scenarios used in the SA were ultimately based on random sampling, in some simulations (specifically, in 83,679 simulations), the value of 'initial topsoil porosity' entailed an initial topsoil bulk density which, by chance, exceeded the value of 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow'.  Therefore,  in  the  variants  of  the  modelled  system  corresponding  to  these simulations, the soil was entirely denuded of herbage cover from the very beginning. Moreover, it is likely that, in some other simulations (variants), the value of 'initial topsoil porosity' meant that topsoil bulk density was initially below the threshold but sufficiently close to it for the disappearance of herbage mass to happen within the\n\nsimulation period (recall from Section 2.1 that topsoil bulk density increases as soil is eroded). Hence, the combined effect of the parameters in question can be interpreted as the effect of a shortage of herbage mass. As a corollary, it is likely that shortages of herbage mass caused by a decrease in precipitation will seriously affect soil masses in private farming systems, though will leave their socio-economic components relatively unaffected.\n\nvi. Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), standing herbage biomass was mostly  sensitive  to  'average  rainfall  depth  per  time  step'  (positive  relationship), 'average reference evapotranspiration depth per time step' (negative relationship) and 'average  probability  of  rainfall  during  one  time  step'  (positive"

Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), standing herbage biomass was mostly  sensitive  to  'average  rainfall  depth  per  time  step'  (positive  relationship), 'average reference evapotranspiration depth per time step' (negative relationship) and 'average  probability  of  rainfall  during  one  time  step'  (positive  relationship).  By comparison,  parameters  related  to  rainfall  variability,  including  those  related  to droughts, were relatively unimportant. Hence, it is likely that a decrease in precipitation will significantly reduce the availability of forage, at least in annual grasslands.\n\nvii. Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), soil depth was mostly sensitive to rainfall variability, i.e. to 'standard deviation of rainfall depth per time step' (negative relationship). By comparison, parameters related to the amount of rainfall per time step, i.e. 'average probability of rainfall during one time step' and 'average rainfall depth per time step of rain', which showed negative relationships with soil depth, were relatively unimportant. Hence, it is likely that climate change will increase erosion rates, at least in annual grasslands, because the effect of a decrease in precipitation in reducing soil erosion  will  likely  not  compensate  for  the  increases  caused  by  a  rise  in  rainfall torrentiality and more exposed soils.\n\nFinally, we should add that the sensitivity of soil depth to the level of the world/regional price of meat was 0.0003 (not included in Table 1). Hence, soil erosion would be around eight hundred times less sensitive to this factor than to rainfall variability, as stated in Section 1.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOverall, the key findings from our modelling assessment are:\n\nFinding  #1:  It  is  likely  that  at  least  annual  grasslands  will  suffer  environmental degradation in the future, and it is likely that such degradation will be primarily caused by climate change, and not by the increasing demand for livestock products.\n\nFinding #2: Private farming systems provide social and economic security to farmers against the effects of climate change, especially in a scenario of rising prices of animal products.\n\nAlthough the simulation results shown in Section 3 strongly support these findings, they can only be taken as broad statements because modelling invariably involves making simplifying assumptions  and dealing with unknowns.  Therefore,  it is  recognized  that increases  in livestock numbers could  significantly contribute to land degradation  in certain areas or periods of time, and that other types of grazing systems, e.g. communal systems, could also cope with climate change.\n\nWe have not found other studies  that support or contradict Finding #1. Many  have evaluated  the  likely  effects of climate change and stocking rates  on  the provision of ecosystem services in rangelands  (see references in Section 1). But  it seems that no previous study has compared the environmental effects of climate change with those of changes in the drivers of stocking rates,  even  though this  is  an  essential assessment, because  the  stocking  rate  is  an  endogenous  factor,  not  a  driver  (Section  1).  Our contribution consisted in estimating the sensitivities of five key endogenous factors in commercial rangelands, including stocking rate, to the same percentage variation in 70 factors,  including  economic and climate drivers.  In doing so,  each factor could be ranked and compared in importance with others. However, it was beyond the scope of this study to review long-term projections on economic and climate variables. Thus, the question of whether the percentage variations in the former might exceed in the future the percentage variations in the latter to the point that grazing effects will keep up with, or exceed, climate change effects remains unanswered. All we can say here is that it is unlikely  (Finding  #1),  because  the  estimated  sensitivities  of  the  endogenous environmental factors to climate drivers turned out to be hundreds of times greater than those to the economic ones.\n\nFinding  #2  may  come  as  no  surprise,  if  only  because  supplementary  feeding  is  a common strategy for coping with weather variability (Martínez-Valderrama et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2015;  Kachergis  et al., 2014).  On the disadvantage side, Finding #2 implies that farmers would not perceive degradation as a concern, whatever its cause may be. This can be a serious problem affecting commercial agriculture in general, as has been pointed out by some authors (Ibáñez et al., 2014b; Vetter, 2005). However, noting that the model takes for granted that farmers respond exclusively to economic indicators,  our assessment shows  that, in general terms, such a behaviour  would not\n\npose a major threat to the provision of ecosystem services in private farming systems (Finding #1).\n\nIt  should  be  clear  that  our  study  did  not  aim  at  comparing  the  advantages  and disadvantages of different grazing systems, simply because just  a single  system was evaluated. Therefore, Finding #2 could only be an argument supporting the conversion of  communal rangelands into private  farms  if there is convincing evidence  that the former  system  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  And  to  find  such  evidence,  more integrated assessments are necessary. In the only study of this type that we know of, Dougill et al. (2010), by\n######################\nOutput:",

By comparison,  parameters  related  to  rainfall  variability,  including  those  related  to droughts, were relatively unimportant. Hence, it is likely that a decrease in precipitation will significantly reduce the availability of forage, at least in annual grasslands.\n\nvii. Apart from the parameters mentioned in point (v), soil depth was mostly sensitive to rainfall variability, i.e. to 'standard deviation of rainfall depth per time step' (negative relationship). By comparison, parameters related to the amount of rainfall per time step, i.e. 'average probability of rainfall during one time step' and 'average rainfall depth per time step of rain', which showed negative relationships with soil depth, were relatively unimportant. Hence, it is likely that climate change will increase erosion rates, at least in annual grasslands, because the effect of a decrease in precipitation in reducing soil erosion  will  likely  not  compensate  for  the  increases  caused  by  a  rise  in  rainfall torrentiality and more exposed soils.\n\nFinally, we should add that the sensitivity of soil depth to the level of the world/regional price of meat was 0.0003 (not included in Table 1). Hence, soil erosion would be around eight hundred times less sensitive to this factor than to rainfall variability, as stated in Section 1.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOverall, the key findings from our modelling assessment are:\n\nFinding  #1:  It  is  likely  that  at  least  annual  grasslands  will  suffer  environmental degradation in the future, and it is likely that such degradation will be primarily caused by climate change, and not by the increasing demand for livestock products.\n\nFinding #2: Private farming systems provide social and economic security to farmers against the effects of climate change, especially in a scenario of rising prices of animal products.\n\nAlthough the simulation results shown in Section 3 strongly support these findings, they can only be taken as broad statements because modelling invariably involves making simplifying assumptions  and dealing with unknowns.  Therefore,  it is  recognized  that increases  in livestock numbers could  significantly contribute to land degradation  in certain areas or periods of time, and that other types of grazing systems, e.g. communal systems, could also cope with climate change.\n\nWe have not found other studies  that support or contradict Finding #1. Many  have evaluated  the  likely  effects of climate change and stocking rates  on  the provision of ecosystem services in rangelands  (see references in Section 1). But  it seems that no previous study has compared the environmental effects of climate change with those of changes in the drivers of stocking rates,  even  though this  is  an  essential assessment, because  the  stocking  rate  is  an  endogenous  factor,  not  a  driver  (Section  1).  Our contribution consisted in estimating the sensitivities of five key endogenous factors in commercial rangelands, including stocking rate, to the same percentage variation in 70 factors,  including  economic and climate drivers.  In doing so,  each factor could be ranked and compared in importance with others. However, it was beyond the scope of this study to review long-term projections on economic and climate variables. Thus, the question of whether the percentage variations in the former might exceed in the future the percentage variations in the latter to the point that grazing effects will keep up with, or exceed, climate change effects remains unanswered. All we can say here is that it is unlikely  (Finding  #1),  because  the  estimated  sensitivities  of  the  endogenous environmental factors to climate drivers turned out to be hundreds of times greater than those to the economic ones.\n\nFinding  #2  may  come  as  no  surprise,  if  only  because  supplementary  feeding  is  a common strategy for coping with weather variability (Martínez-Valderrama et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2015;  Kachergis  et al., 2014).  On the disadvantage side, Finding #2 implies that farmers would not perceive degradation as a concern, whatever its cause may be. This can be a serious problem affecting commercial agriculture in general, as has been pointed out by some authors (Ibáñez et al., 2014b; Vetter, 2005). However, noting that the model takes for granted that farmers respond exclusively to economic indicators,  our assessment shows  that, in general terms, such a behaviour  would not\n\npose a major threat to the provision of ecosystem services in private farming systems (Finding #1).\n\nIt  should  be  clear  that  our  study  did  not  aim  at  comparing  the  advantages  and disadvantages of different grazing systems, simply because just  a single  system was evaluated. Therefore, Finding #2 could only be an argument supporting the conversion of  communal rangelands into private  farms  if there is convincing evidence  that the former  system  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  And  to  find  such  evidence,  more integrated assessments are necessary. In the only study of this type that we know of, Dougill et al. (2010), by"

Therefore, Finding #2 could only be an argument supporting the conversion of  communal rangelands into private  farms  if there is convincing evidence  that the former  system  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  And  to  find  such  evidence,  more integrated assessments are necessary. In the only study of this type that we know of, Dougill et al. (2010), by also making use of an integrated dynamic model, found that communal systems in the Kalahari region are much more vulnerable to climate change than private farms, even under a market growth scenario, and suggest land privatization as well as  a  greater sharing of knowledge from  private  to  communal  producers  as solutions.\n\nOur assessment relies on the adequacies of a model and an assessment procedure. Thus, it is worth considering their strengths and weaknesses, and the extent to which the latter could affect our key findings. Let's start by saying that the model exclusively includes processes and relationships that are widely accepted (well documented) or grounded on a compelling logic. This is why issues such as the possible effects of livestock grazing on water use efficiency and species composition of herbage mass were  disregarded. These are highly  controversial issues for which, today, there is no widely accepted explanation (Ferner et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Oñatibia and Aguiar, 2016; Reid et al.,  2014;  Vetter,  2005;  Sullivan  and  Rohde,  2002;  Illius  and  O'Connor,  1999; Perevolotski  and  Seligman,  1998;  Milchunas  and  Lauenroth,  1993;  Wilson  and MacLeod,  1991).  Nevertheless,  with  hindsight,  simulation  results  suggest  that  both issues would be relatively unimportant when considered within a wide context. Indeed, note that the  model formulates the herbage growth rate (out of bare soil areas)  as a fraction of the parameter 'potential growth rate of green herbage'. Such a fraction varies with soil moisture over the simulation period. Thus, it equals one, i.e. the actual herbage growth rate equals the potential rate, only if soil moisture is at field capacity and no soil, i.e. no water storage capacity, has been lost by erosion. Otherwise, the fraction is less than one,  reaching  zero  whenever  soil water content is at wilting point  or when soil mass runs out (see Eq. 29 in the Supplementary Document for details). Therefore, for the model to reflect that livestock affect water use efficiency or cause an undesirable change  in  herbage  composition,  the  fraction  in  question  should  be  related  to  the\n\nhistorical stocking rate, apart from soil moisture, e.g. the additional condition for it to be one would be that the whole area is ungrazed. But the parameter 'potential growth rate of green herbage'  (abbreviated as 'GH pot. growth rate' in Table 1)  had a negligible effect in all target variables except, needless to say, on standing herbage biomass. Hence, incorporating the mentioned relationship could hardly change the key findings of our assessment.

Therefore, Finding #2 could only be an argument supporting the conversion of  communal rangelands into private  farms  if there is convincing evidence  that the former  system  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  And  to  find  such  evidence,  more integrated assessments are necessary. In the only study of this type that we know of, Dougill et al. (2010), by also making use of an integrated dynamic model, found that communal systems in the Kalahari region are much more vulnerable to climate change than private farms, even under a market growth scenario, and suggest land privatization as well as  a  greater sharing of knowledge from  private  to  communal  producers  as solutions.\n\nOur assessment relies on the adequacies of a model and an assessment procedure. Thus, it is worth considering their strengths and weaknesses, and the extent to which the latter could affect our key findings. Let's start by saying that the model exclusively includes processes and relationships that are widely accepted (well documented) or grounded on a compelling logic. This is why issues such as the possible effects of livestock grazing on water use efficiency and species composition of herbage mass were  disregarded. These are highly  controversial issues for which, today, there is no widely accepted explanation (Ferner et al., 2018; Sayre et al., 2017; Oñatibia and Aguiar, 2016; Reid et al.,  2014;  Vetter,  2005;  Sullivan  and  Rohde,  2002;  Illius  and  O'Connor,  1999; Perevolotski  and  Seligman,  1998;  Milchunas  and  Lauenroth,  1993;  Wilson  and MacLeod,  1991).  Nevertheless,  with  hindsight,  simulation  results  suggest  that  both issues would be relatively unimportant when considered within a wide context. Indeed, note that the  model formulates the herbage growth rate (out of bare soil areas)  as a fraction of the parameter 'potential growth rate of green herbage'. Such a fraction varies with soil moisture over the simulation period. Thus, it equals one, i.e. the actual herbage growth rate equals the potential rate, only if soil moisture is at field capacity and no soil, i.e. no water storage capacity, has been lost by erosion. Otherwise, the fraction is less than one,  reaching  zero  whenever  soil water content is at wilting point  or when soil mass runs out (see Eq. 29 in the Supplementary Document for details). Therefore, for the model to reflect that livestock affect water use efficiency or cause an undesirable change  in  herbage  composition,  the  fraction  in  question  should  be  related  to  the\n\nhistorical stocking rate, apart from soil moisture, e.g. the additional condition for it to be one would be that the whole area is ungrazed. But the parameter 'potential growth rate of green herbage'  (abbreviated as 'GH pot. growth rate' in Table 1)  had a negligible effect in all target variables except, needless to say, on standing herbage biomass. Hence, incorporating the mentioned relationship could hardly change the key findings of our assessment. The same reasoning  would apply  then  to  other factors affecting herbage  productivity  such as increased CO2  levels  (Maestre et al., 2012;  Tietjen and Jeltsch, 2007), the loss of soil nutrients caused by erosion (Illius and O'Connor, 1999) or soil compaction (Pulido et al., 2016). Soil compaction also increases runoff, resulting in  higher erosion rates  (Asner, 2004).  But it is unlikely that incorporating a direct positive relationship between the historical stocking rate and surface runoff could cause socio-economic drivers to enter the list of important effects on soil erosion. This is suggested by the  relatively  low sensitivity  that  soil depth  showed  to  the  parameters involved in determining surface runoff (Table 1).\n\nThe approach adopted for our assessment to consider temporal and spatial variability tried  to  avoid  significantly  increasing  model  complexity,  data  requirements  and unknowns, whereas maintaining the intended generality of the assessment. As explained in Section 2.1, for a given simulation, the model generates temporal variability in drivers, and thus in the entire system, on the basis of a set of parameter values. Also, the representative hectare to which the environmental submodel applies is characterized by means of parameter values for each simulation. Thus, by varying all such values, the SA took account of the long-term evolution of 288,000 hectares differing in the length and gradient of the hill-slope, and in the properties of herbage mass and soil, under the same number of different climate and stocking scenarios. This approach implies sacrificing temporal and spatial precision to generality and realism (Levins, 1966), but it is suitable for a modelling assessment that is aimed at improving understanding of the modelled system and of the way it is expected to react to changes in system drivers (Kelly et al., 2013).\n\nAn  unavoidable  weakness  of  the  model  is  that  many  things  are  assumed  to  be invariable.

Thus,  the  model  does  not  allow  the  production  system,  the  policy environment, the technology, or parameter values to change over the simulation period (300 years). However, it does not seem that these simplifications, strong as they may be, can affect the key findings of our study. Indeed, regarding the production system, it can be expected that climate change will encourage farmers to adopt additional strategies for\n\ndealing with a variable climate, apart from supplementary feeding.  The most salient options  are  substituting part of the business based on selling weaned animals for a yearling business, diversifying activities on the farm, and using shorter grazing periods (Kachergis et al., 2014; Torell et al., 2010; Müller et al., 2007). But given that these are profitable  practices  aimed  at  enhancing  the  resilience  of  farming  operations  and rangeland ecosystems to increasing weather variability, the assumption that farmers will tend to adopt them can only reinforce our key findings.\n\nConcerning  the policy environment,  it is likely that, under a scenario of a growing demand for livestock products, it will be necessary the incorporation of policies aimed at preventing excessive stocking rates in certain areas or during certain periods of time (recall that Finding #1 is a broad statement). Thus, for example, the European Common Agricultural Policy has already incorporated  the cross-compliance system by which payments are conditional upon respecting EU law on environmental, public and animal health, animal welfare and land management  (https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture). However, because this kind of policies protect both farmers' income stability and lands, again the assumption that they will be adopted in the future would reinforce our key findings. Similarly, given that technology helps improve labour efficiencies and make better use of inputs,  the prospect that  new livestock technology will be adopted by farmers would not affect our findings, at least in principle.\n\nLet's consider now the constancy of parameters. We will focus on those parameters that showed  important effects on target variables, but  are not  driver  parameters,  whose constancy was intended, or initial values, for obvious reasons. These are 'bulk density above which herbage does not grow', 'erosion rate calibration parameter' and 'target for the output per LU'  (see Table 1). The first two  parameters  represent features of the modelled hectare. Certainly, they could change over time in certain circumstances. But taking them as invariable  conforms to the intended generality of our assessment.  In contrast, it is likely that farmers will aim at maximizing 'target for the output per LU' in the  future,  because  it  showed  a  positive  effect  on  profits.  Changing  the  breed  of livestock offers a limited scope for improvement. The most effective alternative would be to incorporate a yearling business, a possibility that has already been commented.\n\nIt was explained in Section 2.2 that, although most of the default parameter values used for the assessment were derived from data on a specific case study (Spanish dehesas), we intended to make findings that could be generalized beyond this case. To this end, the parametric scenarios for the SA were generated by sampling each parameter within\n\na wide range around its default  value (±30%), i.e. by covering a great diversity of variants of the modelled system  and  of the external scenarios.  This  procedure  seems acceptable for known or approximated parameters, which are the majority (see Table SD1 in the Supplementary Document),  but  what about the unknown  parameters?  It would take long to present a careful examination, so, for the sake of brevity, we will only stress that, fortunately, no unknown parameter ranked among the most important ones, thereby suggesting that our key findings would not be unduly affected by a lack of knowledge.\n\nOur  assessment  was not aimed at  evaluating  the impacts of the mobility of  global capital and the increasing demand for certain crops and renewable energy. However, it is possible to make two final  comments in regard  to such drivers.  First,  it is worth noting  that,  in  the  assessment,  default  values  of  the  managerial  parameters  (4 parameters) defined farmers as conservative, on average, i.e. as relatively unresponsive to expected profits. More specifically, the default scenario specified  that  farmers  are cautious of changing the size of the reproductive herd or the amount of supplementation provided to animals. In so doing, we just reflected the type of farmers depicted by the interviews with farm owners that provided part of the available data (Ibáñez et al., 2014a).  Ibáñez and Martínez-Valderrama  (2018), by utilizing a section  of the same model  used  here,  found  that  a  widespread  conservatism  would  be  optimal  for commercial farming areas from economic, social, and ecological perspectives. Thus, it is possible that farmers have managed to find this optimum in areas with a long history of grazing, as is the case of Spanish dehesas. The same authors found that the opposite group  behaviour, i.e. a widespread opportunism,  would  perform better economically, but worse socially and ecologically. It is unlikely that traditional  farmers  will  ever decide to adopt an opportunistic strategy, which is risky and requires special skills and experience  to  master.  However,  the  mobility\n######################\nOutput:",

The same authors found that the opposite group  behaviour, i.e. a widespread opportunism,  would  perform better economically, but worse socially and ecologically. It is unlikely that traditional  farmers  will  ever decide to adopt an opportunistic strategy, which is risky and requires special skills and experience  to  master.  However,  the  mobility  of  global  capital  might  result  in  the purchase of rangelands by investors that take livestock as a mere asset, among whom a widespread opportunism could prevail. It is unlikely that our key findings would apply to  these  rangelands. Second, we have seen that, in general terms, cautiously-managed grazing  systems  would  provide  social  and  economic  benefits  without  reducing  the provision of ecosystem services to society. This is a key argument against a careless conversion of  rangelands to crop production, a conversion that  has  often resulted  in social crises and environmental collapses (Herrick et al., 2012; Reynolds et al., 2007; Rowntree et al., 2004).\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nRangeland research should address the lack of studies aiming at comparing the social and environmental effects of drivers of change in rangelands, where 'driver' means factor that affects the rangeland but is not affected by it. Clearly,  livestock  have an undeniable potential for impacting  rangelands,  and  it is crucial to investigate such potential effects.  But  because  the stocking rate is not a driver, it is also crucial to investigate the environmental  effects of changes in  its  determinants.  In commercial rangelands, such determinants are economic, climatic and managerial, so integrated assessments, particularly integrated modelling assessments, are required. The need for taking  social  issues  into  consideration  additionally  advocate  a  multidisciplinary integration.\n\nIn this paper, an integrated modelling assessment has been presented. The research has proved very fruitful, and led to clear findings (see Sections 3 and 4). However, it will remain incomplete until its methods and results can be contrasted with other similar assessments\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nReferences\n\nAsner, G.P., Elmore, A.J., Olander, L.P., Martin, R.E., Harris, A.T., 2004.

In commercial rangelands, such determinants are economic, climatic and managerial, so integrated assessments, particularly integrated modelling assessments, are required. The need for taking  social  issues  into  consideration  additionally  advocate  a  multidisciplinary integration.\n\nIn this paper, an integrated modelling assessment has been presented. The research has proved very fruitful, and led to clear findings (see Sections 3 and 4). However, it will remain incomplete until its methods and results can be contrasted with other similar assessments\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nReferences\n\nAsner, G.P., Elmore, A.J., Olander, L.P., Martin, R.E., Harris, A.T., 2004.

Following the standard New Keynesian narrative, firms operating under monopolistic competition raise their prices, however, given nominal rigidities, this change is insufficient to fully restore the original equilibrium. The labor demand curve shifts outwards, hours worked and output rise; this implies an increase in the real wage (not shown). In contrast to the representative-agent paradigm, the presence of a high marginal propensity to consume agents ( 𝐻 ) means that they will see a boost in their disposable income and raise their consumption. In contrast, capitalists and savers who have access to financial markets will reduce their consumption. As a result, aggregate consumption is slightly crowded out on impact, but it quickly turns positive, and its magnitude depends on the fiscal policy stance. Capital investment, instead, is persistently crowed out in line with the standard transmission mechanism in the presence of investment adjustment costs.\n\nThe effect on real debt can be decomposed into demand and supply-side effects. From the demand side, the strong income effect that pushes up consumption of the hand-to-mouth makes the 𝐻 state less undesirable and, therefore, lowers the liquidity premium, making bond and capital closer substitutes. This induces a shift of the capitalists out of the bond market and into the capital market as their demand for insurance via bonds is reduced ( 𝑍 𝐾 declines for the first three or four quarters, and the initial drop in investment is contained). However, there is a contrasting supply-side effect on capital vs bond investment. This is due to the increase in nominal debt issuance generated by the increase in government spending and by the increase in real debt due to the jump in inflation\n\nand the real interest rate. This standard 'interest rate' channel makes bonds more attractive with respect to capital.\n\nThe relative strength of these two effects depends on the policy mix. When monetary policy is active, the supply side effect dominates (Figure 3). When fiscal policy is passive (solid blue line), the rise in tax revenues corresponds to a smaller increase in inflation, which translates to a smaller decline and faster recovery in the liquidity premium compared with the less passive fiscal policy case (dashed orange line). If the self-insurance motive of capitalists dominates, we would observe a smaller drop in investment in the less passive fiscal policy case, while our simulations show the opposite. This is evidence that the supply-side effect is driving the response of real debt to the fiscal shock.\n\nThe different behavior of inflation and the liquidity premium also explain the different fiscal multipliers under the two fiscal policy scenarios. On impact, the fiscal multiplier is slightly larger under passive fiscal policy, but the difference widens when looking at the cumulative effect.\n\nFigure 4 shows the responses for the case of passive monetary policy. Compared to the case of active monetary, the impact of the shock is qualitatively similar for many variables, as the standard New-Keynesian narrative also applies in this case. Quantitatively, however, we observe a substantially larger fiscal multiplier, a larger increase in inflation, and a smaller rise in the real rate. When the central bank lets inflation increase by a larger amount, the demand effect of the fiscal shock is magnified. This induces a stronger income effect on the hand-to-mouth, which reduces even further the self-insurance motive of capitalists. Their shift away from the bond market is much more pronounced and persistent. Therefore, in this case, the demand effect now dominates over the supply of new public debt. Under both fiscal policy scenarios, capitalists substitute bonds for capital ( 𝑍 𝐾 is negative and persistent). When fiscal policy is less passive, we even observe a decline in real government debt for a few quarters. Finally, we also notice how, under the less passive fiscal policy, the increase in inflation is so large that it generates a substantial decline in real tax revenues, which frees up disposable income and generates an increase in consumption for both capitalists and savers.\n\nAnother way to highlight the importance of the demand side effect coming from the reduced\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate. All variables related to fiscal policy are in % deviation from the steady state of output. The remaining variables are in % deviations from their steady state. We plot the next period realized rental rate of capital ( 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 ). Consumption, Z's, and B's are island-wide figures (multiplied by the population sizes Π 's).\n\ninsurance motive of capitalists is to look, as we did for the technology shock case, at the same impulse responses in the two-agent version of the model where only the supply side effect is at play (see online Appendix D). Simulations show once again that, given the monetary policy stance, fiscal policy does not have a visible impact on macroeconomic variables in the two-agent economy. Let's consider the passive monetary policy scenario in Figure D6 for example. In this model, capital and\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate.

        "text": "debt when different combinations of monetary and fiscal policy lead to different behaviors of inflation.\n\nFigure 3 shows the responses of key variables to a persistent ( 𝜌 𝑔 = 0 . 9) increase in G of 1% in terms of output for the case of active monetary policy. 8 The increase in government purchases raises the level of aggregate demand in the economy. Following the standard New Keynesian narrative, firms operating under monopolistic competition raise their prices, however, given nominal rigidities, this change is insufficient to fully restore the original equilibrium. The labor demand curve shifts outwards, hours worked and output rise; this implies an increase in the real wage (not shown). In contrast to the representative-agent paradigm, the presence of a high marginal propensity to consume agents ( 𝐻 ) means that they will see a boost in their disposable income and raise their consumption. In contrast, capitalists and savers who have access to financial markets will reduce their consumption. As a result, aggregate consumption is slightly crowded out on impact, but it quickly turns positive, and its magnitude depends on the fiscal policy stance. Capital investment, instead, is persistently crowed out in line with the standard transmission mechanism in the presence of investment adjustment costs.\n\nThe effect on real debt can be decomposed into demand and supply-side effects. From the demand side, the strong income effect that pushes up consumption of the hand-to-mouth makes the 𝐻 state less undesirable and, therefore, lowers the liquidity premium, making bond and capital closer substitutes. This induces a shift of the capitalists out of the bond market and into the capital market as their demand for insurance via bonds is reduced ( 𝑍 𝐾 declines for the first three or four quarters, and the initial drop in investment is contained). However, there is a contrasting supply-side effect on capital vs bond investment. This is due to the increase in nominal debt issuance generated by the increase in government spending and by the increase in real debt due to the jump in inflation\n\nand the real interest rate. This standard 'interest rate' channel makes bonds more attractive with respect to capital.\n\nThe relative strength of these two effects depends on the policy mix. When monetary policy is active, the supply side effect dominates (Figure 3). When fiscal policy is passive (solid blue line), the rise in tax revenues corresponds to a smaller increase in inflation, which translates to a smaller decline and faster recovery in the liquidity premium compared with the less passive fiscal policy case (dashed orange line). If the self-insurance motive of capitalists dominates, we would observe a smaller drop in investment in the less passive fiscal policy case, while our simulations show the opposite. This is evidence that the supply-side effect is driving the response of real debt to the fiscal shock.\n\nThe different behavior of inflation and the liquidity premium also explain the different fiscal multipliers under the two fiscal policy scenarios. On impact, the fiscal multiplier is slightly larger under passive fiscal policy, but the difference widens when looking at the cumulative effect.\n\nFigure 4 shows the responses for the case of passive monetary policy. Compared to the case of active monetary, the impact of the shock is qualitatively similar for many variables, as the standard New-Keynesian narrative also applies in this case. Quantitatively, however, we observe a substantially larger fiscal multiplier, a larger increase in inflation, and a smaller rise in the real rate. When the central bank lets inflation increase by a larger amount, the demand effect of the fiscal shock is magnified. This induces a stronger income effect on the hand-to-mouth, which reduces even further the self-insurance motive of capitalists. Their shift away from the bond market is much more pronounced and persistent. Therefore, in this case, the demand effect now dominates over the supply of new public debt. Under both fiscal policy scenarios, capitalists substitute bonds for capital ( 𝑍 𝐾 is negative and persistent). When fiscal policy is less passive, we even observe a decline in real government debt for a few quarters. Finally, we also notice how, under the less passive fiscal policy, the increase in inflation is so large that it generates a substantial decline in real tax revenues, which frees up disposable income and generates an increase in consumption for both capitalists and savers.\n\nAnother way to highlight the importance of the demand side effect coming from the reduced\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate. All variables related to fiscal policy are in % deviation from the steady state of output. The remaining variables are in % deviations from their steady state. We plot the next period realized rental rate of capital ( 𝑅 𝐾 𝑡 + 1 ). Consumption, Z's, and B's are island-wide figures (multiplied by the population sizes Π 's).\n\ninsurance motive of capitalists is to look, as we did for the technology shock case, at the same impulse responses in the two-agent version of the model where only the supply side effect is at play (see online Appendix D). Simulations show once again that, given the monetary policy stance, fiscal policy does not have a visible impact on macroeconomic variables in the two-agent economy. Let's consider the passive monetary policy scenario in Figure D6 for example. In this model, capital and\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate.

Consumption, Z's, and B's are island-wide figures (multiplied by the population sizes Π 's).\n\nbonds are perfect substitutes, and therefore, the capitalists do not substitute bonds for capital"

Hence, we look at the effect of a monetary policy shock on the economy.\n\nFigure 5 shows the responses of key variables to a persistent ( 𝜌 𝑚 = 0 . 3) increase in 𝑀 for the case of active monetary policy. The standard NK transmission of monetary policy is at play. The decrease in the nominal interest rate induces an increase in the marginal cost and inflation as well as consumption of all agents, hours worked, output, and investment. Importantly, we note how this shock decreases the self-insurance motive because the consumption of capitalists increases less than the consumption of hand-to-mouth on impact. As a result, this induces capitalists to substitute investment in bonds with investment in physical capital, therefore pushing aggregate investment further up. The increase in the price level has a negative impact on real debt and spending. This means that the standard supply channel makes bonds even further less attractive than capital. This second channel, as well as the effect on real tax revenues and obviously on inflation, depends on the fiscal stance. With less passive fiscal policy, we observe a larger increase in investment, which translates into a larger and more persistent output above the trend.\n\nTurning to the case of passive monetary policy (Figure 6), we can see the standard NK transmission of monetary policy at play again. However, now the effect of the fiscal stance flips compared to the previous case. When monetary policy is passive, a less passive fiscal policy substantially reduces inflation after the first period. This, in turn, negatively affects the disposable income of hand-to-mouth via its effect on real taxes and pushes the liquidity premium up, resulting in aggregate investment and output being below the case with a more passive fiscal policy.\n\nAs for the previous two shocks, we also show simulations for the two-agent version of the model in online Appendix D. The results, once more, confirm that the fiscal policy stance does not affect the macroeconomic variables in the two-agent economy. This is because of the absence of the self-insurance motive of the capitalists.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate.

Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 256 × 256 model's performance. The visual understanding performances are presented in Tab. 1.

In our model, both understanding and generation exploits images of resolution 384.\n\nFor multimodal understanding, we leverage SigLIP-Large-Patch/16 [102] as 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . For image generation, we utilize the pre-trained SDXL-VAE [71] for its latent space. The generation encoder 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 comprises a 2 × 2 patchify layer followed by two ConvNeXt [92] blocks and a linear layer. The generation decoder 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 combines two ConvNeXt blocks, a pixel-shuffle layer to upsample the feature map, and a linear layer. Our SigLIP encoder contains ∼ 300M parameters. 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 are light-weight modules, containing ∼ 70M parameters in total. Table 1 details the hyperparameters for each training stage. In the alignment regularization, we use the LLM features after the 6th block as 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) and a three-layer MLP as ℎ 𝜑 . We employ an exponential moving average (EMA) with a ratio of 0.99 to ensure training stability.\n\nFor data preprocessing, we deal with understanding and generation data differently. For understanding tasks, we maintain all image information by resizing the long side to the target size and padding the image to squares. For generation tasks, we resize the short side to the target size and apply random square cropping to avoid padding artifacts. During training, multiple sequences are packed to form a single sequence of length 4, 096 for training efficiency. Our implementation is based on the HAI-LLM platform [31] using PyTorch [72]. Training was conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with each model requiring ∼ 1, 600 A100 GPU days.\n\n4.2. Training Data Settings\n\nWe follow Janus [93] to construct the training data. The data configuration for each training stage is listed below.\n\nData for Stage 1 and Stage 2. The first two stages of our framework uses three types of data: multimodal understanding data, image generation data and text-only data.\n\n 1. Multimodal Understanding Data. This type of data contains several sub-categories: (a) Image caption data. We incorporate caption datasets from [20, 41, 50, 51, 53, 79] and generate additional captions for images from [16, 43] using open-source multimodal understanding models. The data follows template formats, e . g ., ' <image>Generate the caption of this picture. <caption> '. (b) Charts and tables. We directly adopt the chart and table data from the training data of DeepSeek-VL [63]. (c) Task data. ShareGPT4V [11] data is utilized to facilitate basic question-answering capabilities during pre-training,\n\n<missing-text>\n\nstructured as ' <image><question><answer> '. (d) Interleaved text-image data. This sub-category is sourced from [42, 81].\n\n 2. Image Generation Data. Our image generation dataset combines high-quality images from [16, 21, 41, 43, 67, 69, 79, 82] and 2 million in-house data. We enhance them with machinegenerated captions using multimodal understanding models. We filter the images in [16, 79] with aspect ratios and aesthetic scores, retaining approximately 20% of the original datasets. 25% of the data contains single-sentence captions. These kind of data assist the model to be able to process short prompts. All the data points are formatted as ' <prompt><image> '.\n\n 3. Text-Only Data. We directly use the text corpus of DeepSeek-LLM [7].\n\nData for Stage 3. The SFT stage also uses three types of data:\n\n 1. Multimodal Instruction Data. We leverage the instruction tuning datasets from [29, 33, 35, 47, 64, 78].\n\n 2. Image Generation Data. We reformat the high-quality text-image pairs from [16, 79, 82] into an instruction format: ' User:<user prompt>\\n\\n Assistant:<image> '.\n\n 3. Text-Only Data. We directly incorporate the text-only data from [47].\n\n4.3. Evaluation Settings\n\nImage Generation. We evaluate the generated images using both visual quality and semantic accuracy metrics. For visual quality assessment, we employ the Fréchet Inception Distance [30] (FID) metric and compute FID between 30,000 generated images and their corresponding reference images from the MJHQ dataset [48]. The FID computation follows the implementation from GigaGAN [39]. To evaluate semantic accuracy, we utilize two specialized frameworks: GenEval [28] and DPG-Bench [34]. These frameworks are designed to assess whether the generated images accurately contain the objects and relationships specified in the input prompts, providing a broad evaluation of the generation capabilities.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nMultimodal Understanding. We evaluate JanusFlow's multimodal understanding abilities across a diverse set of vision-language benchmarks for general understanding capabilities, including POPE [52], MME [24], MMBench [62], SEEDBench [46], VQAv2 [29], GQA [35], MMVet [100], and MMMU [101].\n\n4.4. Quantitative Results\n\nImage Generation Performances. We report the performances on GenEval, DPG-Bench and MJHQ FID-30k. In\n######################\nOutput:",

Our SigLIP encoder contains ∼ 300M parameters. 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 are light-weight modules, containing ∼ 70M parameters in total. Table 1 details the hyperparameters for each training stage. In the alignment regularization, we use the LLM features after the 6th block as 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) and a three-layer MLP as ℎ 𝜑 . We employ an exponential moving average (EMA) with a ratio of 0.99 to ensure training stability.\n\nFor data preprocessing, we deal with understanding and generation data differently. For understanding tasks, we maintain all image information by resizing the long side to the target size and padding the image to squares. For generation tasks, we resize the short side to the target size and apply random square cropping to avoid padding artifacts. During training, multiple sequences are packed to form a single sequence of length 4, 096 for training efficiency. Our implementation is based on the HAI-LLM platform [31] using PyTorch [72]. Training was conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with each model requiring ∼ 1, 600 A100 GPU days.\n\n4.2. Training Data Settings\n\nWe follow Janus [93] to construct the training data. The data configuration for each training stage is listed below.\n\nData for Stage 1 and Stage 2. The first two stages of our framework uses three types of data: multimodal understanding data, image generation data and text-only data.\n\n 1. Multimodal Understanding Data. This type of data contains several sub-categories: (a) Image caption data. We incorporate caption datasets from [20, 41, 50, 51, 53, 79] and generate additional captions for images from [16, 43] using open-source multimodal understanding models. The data follows template formats, e . g ., ' <image>Generate the caption of this picture. <caption> '. (b) Charts and tables. We directly adopt the chart and table data from the training data of DeepSeek-VL [63]. (c) Task data. ShareGPT4V [11] data is utilized to facilitate basic question-answering capabilities during pre-training,\n\n<missing-text>\n\nstructured as ' <image><question><answer> '. (d) Interleaved text-image data. This sub-category is sourced from [42, 81].\n\n 2. Image Generation Data. Our image generation dataset combines high-quality images from [16, 21, 41, 43, 67, 69, 79, 82] and 2 million in-house data. We enhance them with machinegenerated captions using multimodal understanding models. We filter the images in [16, 79] with aspect ratios and aesthetic scores, retaining approximately 20% of the original datasets. 25% of the data contains single-sentence captions. These kind of data assist the model to be able to process short prompts. All the data points are formatted as ' <prompt><image> '.\n\n 3. Text-Only Data. We directly use the text corpus of DeepSeek-LLM [7].\n\nData for Stage 3. The SFT stage also uses three types of data:\n\n 1. Multimodal Instruction Data. We leverage the instruction tuning datasets from [29, 33, 35, 47, 64, 78].\n\n 2. Image Generation Data. We reformat the high-quality text-image pairs from [16, 79, 82] into an instruction format: ' User:<user prompt>\\n\\n Assistant:<image> '.\n\n 3. Text-Only Data. We directly incorporate the text-only data from [47].\n\n4.3. Evaluation Settings\n\nImage Generation. We evaluate the generated images using both visual quality and semantic accuracy metrics. For visual quality assessment, we employ the Fréchet Inception Distance [30] (FID) metric and compute FID between 30,000 generated images and their corresponding reference images from the MJHQ dataset [48]. The FID computation follows the implementation from GigaGAN [39]. To evaluate semantic accuracy, we utilize two specialized frameworks: GenEval [28] and DPG-Bench [34]. These frameworks are designed to assess whether the generated images accurately contain the objects and relationships specified in the input prompts, providing a broad evaluation of the generation capabilities.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nMultimodal Understanding. We evaluate JanusFlow's multimodal understanding abilities across a diverse set of vision-language benchmarks for general understanding capabilities, including POPE [52], MME [24], MMBench [62], SEEDBench [46], VQAv2 [29], GQA [35], MMVet [100], and MMMU [101].\n\n4.4.

AI*NRDD  is  the  interaction  between Artificial intelligence and nuclear energy budgeting that may influence CO₂ emissions. The MM-QR  models  are  especially  valuable  in  environmental  and  energy  economics  for capturing heterogeneous impacts across different levels of emissions, allowing for a more nuanced policy and investment approach. Finally, perform diagnostic checks to validate the model. This  may  include  testing  the  robustness  of  the  moment  conditions,  checking  for model  misspecification,  and  comparing  the  quantile  regression  estimates  with  other estimation methods.\n\n4.3. Data\n\nThis paper covers the annual dataset for selected 20 OECD countries (refer to Table 1) from 1994 to 2020. The dependent variable is per capita CO 2 emissions (million tons of CO 2 ). Data about CO 2 emission is derived from the British Petroleum Statistical Review (BP, 2021). AI and Nuclear energy technology research and development budgets (NRDD) are used as independent variables to explain CO 2 emissions. The NRDD is measured for nuclear energy technology budgeting and measured (in a million USD and PPP). The NRDD variable can provide important information for SDG 7. AI is measured as the number of registered AI-related patents. Data on NRDD arrives from the International Energy Agency. AI data is taken from OECD databases. The trend in artificial intelligence, nuclear energy RD&D, and CO 2 emissions in sample OECD countries is shown in Figure 3.\n\n======= INSERT FIGURE 3 =======\n\n5. Results\n\nThe first step in panel data analysis is to examine cross-sectional dependence (CD). Refraining from ignoring cross-sectional reliance can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it is advisable to use techniques such as fixed effects with crosssectional averages, factor models, or spatial econometric models to address this dependency issue effectively. This study employs the CD test for this purpose by Pesaran, (2015). The results in Table 2 reject the null hypothesis, indicating that CD exists. Due to this dependence, shared shocks can influence parameter estimates, potentially resulting in biased outcomes in models  that  assume  unit  independence.  In  international  economics,  cross-sectional dependence often suggests that global factors-such as commodity prices, financial crises, or technological spillovers-impact multiple countries simultaneously. This understanding informs the selection of appropriate models and policy recommendations.\n\n======= INSERT TABLE 2 HERE ========\n\nOnce it is proven that the dataset is cross-sectionally dependent, the next step is to use panel unit root tests. These give essential information about the data's structure and help analysts choose the best modeling methods for accurate results. For this purpose, we utilize the CIPS and CADF unit root tests by Pesaran, (2007). The findings in Table 3 indicate a noteworthy test statistic (typically at a 5% significance level), enabling the rejection of the null hypothesis, which suggests that the series is stationary at its first difference. A nonsignificant statistic indicates that the series is non-stationary.\n\n======= INSERT TABLE 3 HERE ========\n\nAdopting artificial intelligence (AI) positively correlates with CO₂ emissions across all quantiles (see Table 4). Generally, an increase in AI adoption leads to an increase in CO 2 emissions, irrespective of the examined emission level (low, medium, or high quantiles). This  finding  suggests  that,  although AI  can  improve  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions  in certain contexts, its deployment might also lead to environmental costs that could outweigh these benefits. A positive coefficient at lower quantiles suggests that, even in nations with relatively  low  emissions,  including  Denmark,  Switzerland,  Norway,  Finland,  Sweden, Portugal, Hungary, and Austria, an increase in AI adoption is associated with higher CO 2 emissions. This could arise from the essential infrastructure and energy needs required for implementing AI technologies in settings that typically show reduced emissions. For average emitters (Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Australia, and Türkiye), a positive coefficient at the median level (e.g., 50th percentile) suggests a link between AI adoption and  increased  emissions. This  indicates  that  the  efficiencies  gained  through AI  may  not adequately offset the emissions generated by data processing, storage, and computational requirements. At  upper  quantiles  (e.g.,  75th  or  90th  percentile),  a  positive  coefficient indicates  that  even  significant  emitters  (Canada,  Germany,  Japan,  and  the  USA)  see  an increase in CO₂ emissions with the rise of AI adoption.

AI*NRDD  is  the  interaction  between Artificial intelligence and nuclear energy budgeting that may influence CO₂ emissions. The MM-QR  models  are  especially  valuable  in  environmental  and  energy  economics  for capturing heterogeneous impacts across different levels of emissions, allowing for a more nuanced policy and investment approach. Finally, perform diagnostic checks to validate the model. This  may  include  testing  the  robustness  of  the  moment  conditions,  checking  for model  misspecification,  and  comparing  the  quantile  regression  estimates  with  other estimation methods.\n\n4.3. Data\n\nThis paper covers the annual dataset for selected 20 OECD countries (refer to Table 1) from 1994 to 2020. The dependent variable is per capita CO 2 emissions (million tons of CO 2 ). Data about CO 2 emission is derived from the British Petroleum Statistical Review (BP, 2021). AI and Nuclear energy technology research and development budgets (NRDD) are used as independent variables to explain CO 2 emissions. The NRDD is measured for nuclear energy technology budgeting and measured (in a million USD and PPP). The NRDD variable can provide important information for SDG 7. AI is measured as the number of registered AI-related patents. Data on NRDD arrives from the International Energy Agency. AI data is taken from OECD databases. The trend in artificial intelligence, nuclear energy RD&D, and CO 2 emissions in sample OECD countries is shown in Figure 3.\n\n======= INSERT FIGURE 3 =======\n\n5. Results\n\nThe first step in panel data analysis is to examine cross-sectional dependence (CD). Refraining from ignoring cross-sectional reliance can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it is advisable to use techniques such as fixed effects with crosssectional averages, factor models, or spatial econometric models to address this dependency issue effectively. This study employs the CD test for this purpose by Pesaran, (2015). The results in Table 2 reject the null hypothesis, indicating that CD exists. Due to this dependence, shared shocks can influence parameter estimates, potentially resulting in biased outcomes in models  that  assume  unit  independence.  In  international  economics,  cross-sectional dependence often suggests that global factors-such as commodity prices, financial crises, or technological spillovers-impact multiple countries simultaneously. This understanding informs the selection of appropriate models and policy recommendations.\n\n======= INSERT TABLE 2 HERE ========\n\nOnce it is proven that the dataset is cross-sectionally dependent, the next step is to use panel unit root tests. These give essential information about the data's structure and help analysts choose the best modeling methods for accurate results. For this purpose, we utilize the CIPS and CADF unit root tests by Pesaran, (2007). The findings in Table 3 indicate a noteworthy test statistic (typically at a 5% significance level), enabling the rejection of the null hypothesis, which suggests that the series is stationary at its first difference. A nonsignificant statistic indicates that the series is non-stationary.\n\n======= INSERT TABLE 3 HERE ========\n\nAdopting artificial intelligence (AI) positively correlates with CO₂ emissions across all quantiles (see Table 4). Generally, an increase in AI adoption leads to an increase in CO 2 emissions, irrespective of the examined emission level (low, medium, or high quantiles). This  finding  suggests  that,  although AI  can  improve  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions  in certain contexts, its deployment might also lead to environmental costs that could outweigh these benefits. A positive coefficient at lower quantiles suggests that, even in nations with relatively  low  emissions,  including  Denmark,  Switzerland,  Norway,  Finland,  Sweden, Portugal, Hungary, and Austria, an increase in AI adoption is associated with higher CO 2 emissions. This could arise from the essential infrastructure and energy needs required for implementing AI technologies in settings that typically show reduced emissions. For average emitters (Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Australia, and Türkiye), a positive coefficient at the median level (e.g., 50th percentile) suggests a link between AI adoption and  increased  emissions. This  indicates  that  the  efficiencies  gained  through AI  may  not adequately offset the emissions generated by data processing, storage, and computational requirements. At  upper  quantiles  (e.g.,  75th  or  90th  percentile),  a  positive  coefficient indicates  that  even  significant  emitters  (Canada,  Germany,  Japan,  and  the  USA)  see  an increase in CO₂ emissions with the rise of AI adoption.

The rationale serves two purposes: enhancing decision accuracy by jointly training the model to generate decisions and explanations, and improving user trust by providing the reasoning in PaSa application.\n\nTo optimize training efficiency for the Crawler, the decision token is presented before the rationale, allowing the Selector to act as a single-token reward model during the Crawler training. Additionally, the token probability of the decision token can be used to rank search results. At last, as shown in Table 7, the order of the decision and rationale does not affect the Selector's performance.\n\nWe perform imitation learning to optimize the Selector.

We conducted supervised fine-tuning for one epoch with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 4. The training runs on 8 NVIDIA-H100 GPUs.\n\nCrawler The training process involves two stages. First, we perform imitation learning for 1 epoch on 12,989 training data with a learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 4 per device, using 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In the second stage, we apply PPO training. To ensure stability, we first freeze the policy model and train the value model, followed by co-training both the policy and value models. The hyperparameters used during the training process are listed in the Table 4.\n\nDuring imitation learning, the model encounters 5,000 queries, while during the RL training phase, the model processes a total of 16,000 queries. For more details please refer to Appendix A.1 for the imitation learning data construction and Appendix A.2 for the PPO training data sampling.\n\nImplementation of [Search] This function utilizes the LLM to predict a query based on the context, and then calls Google 7 with the parameters site:arxiv.org and before:query\\_date ,\n\n<missing-text>\n\nrestricting search results by source and publication time.\n\nPaper Management We developed a database to manage and restore research papers. PaSa retrieves paper information from the database. If no matching record is found, we use ar5iv 8 to obtain the full paper content, including citations, and then parse this data and store it in the database.\n\n5.2 Baselines and Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate our paper search agent on both the test set of AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery. We compare PaSa-7b against the following baselines:\n\n · Google. We use Google to search the query directly, with the same parameter settings in Section 5.1.\n\n · Google Scholar. Queries are submitted directly to Google Scholar 7 , with the same parameter settings in Section 5.1.\n\n · Google with GPT-4o. We first employ GPT4o to paraphrase the scholar query. The paraphrased query is then searched on Google.\n\n · ChatGPT. We submit the scholar query to ChatGPT 9 , powered by search-enabled GPT4o. Due to the need for manual query submis-\n\n<missing-text>\n\n<missing-text>\n\non, we evaluate only 100 randomly sampled instances from the AutoScholarQuery test set.\n\n · GPT-o1. Prompt GPT-o1 to process the scholar query.\n\n · PaSa-GPT-4o. Prompt GPT-4o within the PaSa framework. It can perform multiple searches, paper reading, and citation network crawling.\n\nWe carefully designed prompts for all baselines and they are shown in Appendix E.1.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the crawling process of PaSa can be visualized as a paper tree. In practice, considering the computational expense, we limit the Crawler's exploration depth (starting from the user query) to three for both PaSa-7b and PaSaGPT-4o\n######################\nOutput:",

We then combine these into the unified RL loss:\n\nL RL ( θ, ϕ ) = L policy ( θ ) + η · L value ( ϕ ) (8)\n\nwhere η is the coefficient of the value objective.\n\n4.3 Selector\n\nThe Selector is an LLM agent that takes two inputs: a scholar query and a research paper (including its title and abstract). It generates two outputs: (1) a single decision token d , either \"True\" or \"False\", indicating whether the paper satisfies the query,\n\nand (2) a rationale r = ( r 1 , r 2 , ..., r m ) containing m tokens that support this decision. The rationale serves two purposes: enhancing decision accuracy by jointly training the model to generate decisions and explanations, and improving user trust by providing the reasoning in PaSa application.\n\nTo optimize training efficiency for the Crawler, the decision token is presented before the rationale, allowing the Selector to act as a single-token reward model during the Crawler training. Additionally, the token probability of the decision token can be used to rank search results. At last, as shown in Table 7, the order of the decision and rationale does not affect the Selector's performance.\n\nWe perform imitation learning to optimize the Selector. See Appendix B for training data collection and training details.\n\n5 Experiments\n\n5.1 Experimental Setting\n\nWe sequentially trained the Selector and Crawler, both based on the Qwen2.5-7b (Yang et al., 2024), to develop the final agent, referred to as PaSa-7b.\n\nSelector The Selector was fine-tuned using the training dataset described in Appendix B. We conducted supervised fine-tuning for one epoch with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 4. The training runs on 8 NVIDIA-H100 GPUs.\n\nCrawler The training process involves two stages. First, we perform imitation learning for 1 epoch on 12,989 training data with a learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 4 per device, using 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In the second stage, we apply PPO training. To ensure stability, we first freeze the policy model and train the value model, followed by co-training both the policy and value models. The hyperparameters used during the training process are listed in the Table 4.\n\nDuring imitation learning, the model encounters 5,000 queries, while during the RL training phase, the model processes a total of 16,000 queries. For more details please refer to Appendix A.1 for the imitation learning data construction and Appendix A.2 for the PPO training data sampling.\n\nImplementation of [Search] This function utilizes the LLM to predict a query based on the context, and then calls Google 7 with the parameters site:arxiv.org and before:query\\_date ,\n\n<missing-text>\n\nrestricting search results by source and publication time.\n\nPaper Management We developed a database to manage and restore research papers. PaSa retrieves paper information from the database. If no matching record is found, we use ar5iv 8 to obtain the full paper content, including citations, and then parse this data and store it in the database.\n\n5.2 Baselines and Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate our paper search agent on both the test set of AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery.

(24)\n\nIn the above expression, ' ˜ (·) ' denotes that the variable has been linearized, as opposed to log-linearized (denoted by ' ˆ (·) '), in line with how the literature treats variables that are already expressed as percentages. The proof of this proposition, as well as further details on the analytics of the model, can be found in Appendix I.v.\n\nEquation (24) helps us underpin in higher analytical details the mechanism that generates variations in the liquidity premium as related to self-insurance. The main mechanism is driven by the difference between the consumption of the capitalists and that of the other two types. The intuition behind this is that what determines the liquidity premium is the poor insurance quality of the capital\n\nasset. If the change in the consumption of the three agents is identical in every period, then the liquidity premium is neutralized, as there is no need for self-insurance to begin with. This will make the two assets perfect substitutes. In fact, in this case, the change in consumption will always be the same, regardless of which type the current capitalist will be in the next period. By contrast, if we consider a shock that induces a stronger response of the consumption of the non-hand-to-mouth type vis-'a-vis those hand-to-mouth, we see that the last term in the equation above is likely to dominate. Assuming further that such deviation is positive, we see that it will generate a fall in the liquidity premium. Intuitively, such a shock makes the perspective of the risky hand-to-mouth state not as undesirable and, therefore, reduces the need for self-insurance. For this reason, the willingness to hold government bonds falls, and the real interest rate must increase for the market to clear. Through this mechanism, we see the importance of the interplay between monetary and fiscal policies in shaping the portfolio choice of agents with access to both capital and bond markets. Changes in the supply of government bonds, coupled with a change in their remuneration induced through monetary policy, will generate consumption inequality across the different categories, thereby affecting the need for insurance for the capitalist. This is what we will now study in the rest of the paper.\n\n3 The portfolio channel of monetary and fiscal policy interaction\n\nIn this section, we report the dynamics of the model following a supply ( technology ) and a demand ( fiscal ) shock with a focus on different combinations of the monetary-fiscal policy mix.\n\nFollowing Leeper (1991), for each of these shocks, we consider two scenarios for monetary policy: passive ( 𝜙 𝜋 = 0 . 8) when the nominal interest rate responds less than one to one to inflation; active ( 𝜙 𝜋 = 1 . 2) when the Taylor principle is satisfied. For each of these cases, we consider two scenarios for fiscal policy: passive ( 𝛾 𝑇 = 1) when nominal taxes respond one to one to the increase in nominal debt; less passive ( 𝛾 𝑇 = 0 . 5) when the reaction in taxes is more muted (i.e. fiscal policy decides to reduce as much as possible the increase in taxes to stimulate the economy).\n\n3.1 Technology shock\n\nFirst, in Figure 1 and Figure 2, we analyze the consequences of the portfolio channel on the transmission of a standard supply shock analyzed in the literature, i.e., a temporary and persistent ( 𝜌 𝑎 = 0 . 75 ) technology shock 𝐴 𝑡 . In particular, each figure plots different fiscal regimes for the same monetary regime.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate. All variables related to fiscal policy are in % deviation from the steady state of output. The remaining variables are in % deviations from their steady state.

Since AI-driven techniques can help maximize the  low-carbon  benefits  of  nuclear  energy,  this  moderating  role  is  especially  critical  in maximizing the deployment and utilization of nuclear energy as its facilities can become even  more  effective  in  reducing  emissions  if  AI can  enhance  their  performance  and efficiency.  The  optimal  operation  of  nuclear  power  plants  is  made  possible  by  artificial intelligence  (AI)  in  predictive  maintenance,  defect  detection,  and  real-time  performance monitoring.  This  results  in  reduced  downtime  and  longer  plant  life.  Nuclear  power  can\n\nreduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels more reliably due to its constant and efficient functioning (IAEA, 2023).\n\nTo improve the energy mix's carbon efficiency and decrease the demand for fossil fuel backup energy, AI algorithms can dynamically modulate nuclear production in reaction to changes in renewable generation (IEA, 2022). Emissions reductions are proportional to the degree to which AI enhances the integration of renewables and nuclear energy.\n\nA  regression  model's  interaction  term  allows  one  to  examine  AI's  moderating function. For example, we can construct an empirical model in the following manner:\n\n(2)\n\nIn  this  model,  the  interaction  term  ( LnAI it xLnNRDD it )  would  help  capture  the moderating effect of AI on the relationship between nuclear energy and CO₂ emissions. A negative and statistically significant coefficient for this term would suggest that AI enhances the emissions reduction impact of nuclear energy.\n\n4.2. Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) method\n\nFor empirical estimation, this study used the Method of Moment Quantile MM-QR method  proposed  by  Sim  and  Zhou,  (2015).  Statistics  traditionally  use  the  MM-QR estimation technique to find estimates for model parameters by equating sample moments, such as sample means or variances, to their theoretical counterparts. In quantile regression, the MM-QR estimates the quantiles of the response variable based on the predictors. This gives a more complete picture of how the variables are connected than mean regression. The MoM approach  allows  one  to  obtain  quantile  estimates  without  needing  to  make  strict\n\nassumptions  about  the  underlying  distribution  of  residuals,  making  it  suitable  for heteroscedastic or non-normally distributed data.\n\nThis method provides a comprehensive perspective on the influence of predictors on the  distribution  of  a  response  variable,  extending  beyond  the  mean. This  is  important  in situations where the mean does not sufficiently reflect the data's distribution or when outliers have  a  substantial  impact  on  mean-based  estimates.  This  method  enhances  robustness against outliers and model misspecification, rendering it especially beneficial in domains such  as  finance  and  economics,  where  these  challenges  commonly  occur.  This  method exhibits reduced sensitivity to outliers compared to traditional mean-based regression, as it emphasizes quantiles rather than the entire distribution. The MM-QR method addresses nonnormal distributions, effectively accommodating diverse error structures in the data, such as skewed  or  heavy-tailed  distributions.  MM-QR  offers  a  comprehensive  view  of  the conditional distribution of the response variable, which is essential for analyzing variability and  skewness  in  data.  MM-QR  estimates  parameters  by  addressing  moment  conditions, generally employing optimization methods. In this process, the error between the sample moments and theoretical moments is minimized. After estimating, interpret the regression coefficients  as  effects  on  the  specified  quantile  of  the  response  variable.  These interpretations can provide insights that differ across quantiles and reveal trends not visible in mean regression. For quantile τ, the MMQR equation can be represented as follows:\n\n𝑄 ! (𝐶𝑂 \" 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑋/ = 𝑋 # 𝛽(𝜏) +  𝜖(𝜏) (3)\n\nWhere Q τ (.) : The conditional quantile function of CO₂ emissions at quantile τ. X is a Vector of independent variables, which includes nuclear energy budgeting, AI investment, and interaction variable (AI*NRDD). b τ  Vector of coefficients specific to quantile τ that reflect the impact of each independent variable on CO₂ emissions, and ϵ(τ) is the error term associated with quantile τ.\n\nThe equation can be expanded to explicitly include NRDD and AI, as follows:\n\n𝑄 ! (𝐶𝑂 \" 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷,𝐴𝐼,(𝐴𝐼 ∗ 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷)/ = 𝛽 $ (𝜏) + 𝑋 # 𝛽 % (𝜏). 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷 + 𝑋 # 𝛽 \" (𝜏). �\n######################\nOutput:",

For example, we can construct an empirical model in the following manner:\n\n(2)\n\nIn  this  model,  the  interaction  term  ( LnAI it xLnNRDD it )  would  help  capture  the moderating effect of AI on the relationship between nuclear energy and CO₂ emissions. A negative and statistically significant coefficient for this term would suggest that AI enhances the emissions reduction impact of nuclear energy.\n\n4.2. Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) method\n\nFor empirical estimation, this study used the Method of Moment Quantile MM-QR method  proposed  by  Sim  and  Zhou,  (2015).  Statistics  traditionally  use  the  MM-QR estimation technique to find estimates for model parameters by equating sample moments, such as sample means or variances, to their theoretical counterparts. In quantile regression, the MM-QR estimates the quantiles of the response variable based on the predictors. This gives a more complete picture of how the variables are connected than mean regression. The MoM approach  allows  one  to  obtain  quantile  estimates  without  needing  to  make  strict\n\nassumptions  about  the  underlying  distribution  of  residuals,  making  it  suitable  for heteroscedastic or non-normally distributed data.\n\nThis method provides a comprehensive perspective on the influence of predictors on the  distribution  of  a  response  variable,  extending  beyond  the  mean. This  is  important  in situations where the mean does not sufficiently reflect the data's distribution or when outliers have  a  substantial  impact  on  mean-based  estimates.  This  method  enhances  robustness against outliers and model misspecification, rendering it especially beneficial in domains such  as  finance  and  economics,  where  these  challenges  commonly  occur.  This  method exhibits reduced sensitivity to outliers compared to traditional mean-based regression, as it emphasizes quantiles rather than the entire distribution. The MM-QR method addresses nonnormal distributions, effectively accommodating diverse error structures in the data, such as skewed  or  heavy-tailed  distributions.  MM-QR  offers  a  comprehensive  view  of  the conditional distribution of the response variable, which is essential for analyzing variability and  skewness  in  data.  MM-QR  estimates  parameters  by  addressing  moment  conditions, generally employing optimization methods. In this process, the error between the sample moments and theoretical moments is minimized. After estimating, interpret the regression coefficients  as  effects  on  the  specified  quantile  of  the  response  variable.  These interpretations can provide insights that differ across quantiles and reveal trends not visible in mean regression. For quantile τ, the MMQR equation can be represented as follows:\n\n𝑄 ! (𝐶𝑂 \" 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑋/ = 𝑋 # 𝛽(𝜏) +  𝜖(𝜏) (3)\n\nWhere Q τ (.) : The conditional quantile function of CO₂ emissions at quantile τ. X is a Vector of independent variables, which includes nuclear energy budgeting, AI investment, and interaction variable (AI*NRDD). b τ  Vector of coefficients specific to quantile τ that reflect the impact of each independent variable on CO₂ emissions, and ϵ(τ) is the error term associated with quantile τ.\n\nThe equation can be expanded to explicitly include NRDD and AI, as follows:\n\n𝑄 ! (𝐶𝑂 \" 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷,𝐴𝐼,(𝐴𝐼 ∗ 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷)/ = 𝛽 $ (𝜏) + 𝑋 # 𝛽 % (𝜏). 𝑁𝑅𝐷𝐷 + 𝑋 # 𝛽 \" (𝜏). �"

As equation (24) shows, the key probabilities driving the liquidity premium are 𝜆 𝐾,𝑆 and 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 . Hence, we focus on the calibration of the probabilities related to the flows out of the capitalists island. Precisely we compare the baseline calibration ( 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 = 0 . 8, 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 = 0 . 4) against a higher and lower probability of remaining capitalists (0.9 and 0.7 respectively) and a higher probability of becoming hand-to-mouth (0.05). We show results for the fiscal shock 9 and present the possible combinations between fiscal and monetary policies separately in this case for ease of exposition. The next four figures show that, while there are obvious quantitative differences in the impulse\n\nresponse functions, the overall qualitative picture is not affected by the transition probabilities.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate.

As equation (24) shows, the key probabilities driving the liquidity premium are 𝜆 𝐾,𝑆 and 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 . Hence, we focus on the calibration of the probabilities related to the flows out of the capitalists island. Precisely we compare the baseline calibration ( 𝜆 𝐾,𝐾 = 0 . 8, 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 = 0 . 4) against a higher and lower probability of remaining capitalists (0.9 and 0.7 respectively) and a higher probability of becoming hand-to-mouth (0.05). We show results for the fiscal shock 9 and present the possible combinations between fiscal and monetary policies separately in this case for ease of exposition. The next four figures show that, while there are obvious quantitative differences in the impulse\n\nresponse functions, the overall qualitative picture is not affected by the transition probabilities.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate.

Starting with a query q , the Crawler generates a trajectory τ = ( s 1 , a 1 , · · · , s T , a T ) . At each time step t , we denote the current paper queue as Q t . Upon taking action a t , the Crawler appends a set of new papers ( p 1 , p 2 , · · · , p n t ) to the paper queue. If a t = [Stop] , the set is empty.\n\nThe reward of executing action a t in state s t is defined as\n\nr ( s t , a t ) = α × n t ∑ i =1 I ( q, p i , t ) -c ( a t ) , (1)\n\nwhere I ( q, p i , t ) = 1 if p i matches the query q and is not already in Q t , and I ( q, p i , t ) = 0 otherwise.\n\nHere, α is a reward coefficient, and c ( a t ) is the cost of action a t .\n\nThe indicator function I ( q, p i , t ) can be determined by checking if p i belongs to P - Q t . However, it is important to note that the AutoScholarQuery may only include a subset of the groundtruth papers, as citations often emphasize a limited number of key references. If the Crawler receives rewards solely based on matching papers in AutoScholarQuery, this could lead to sparse rewards during training. To mitigate this, we use the Selector as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler. The revised definition of I ( q, p i , t ) is:\n\nI ( q, p i , t ) =      1 , if ( Selector ( q, p i ) = 1 or p i ∈ P ) and p i / ∈ Q t , 0 , otherwise. (2)\n\nHere Selector ( q, p i ) = 1 if paper p i is identified as correct to meet the query q by the Selector, and Selector ( q, p i ) = 0 otherwise.\n\nRL Training A key challenge in training the Crawler with RL is the significant time required to sample a complete trajectory for a given query. This is due to each [Search] or [Expand] action adding multiple papers to the paper list, resulting in hundreds or even thousands of papers in the final paper queue.\n\nTo address this issue, we define a session as a sub-trajectory that begins with a session's initial state and ends with the [Stop] action. We identify two types of session initial states: S q , which includes only a query, and S q + p , which consists of both a query and a paper.\n\nFormally, we model the Crawler as a policy π θ ( a t | s t ) . We partition the entire trajectory τ into a sequence of sessions: ( τ t 1 : t 2 -1 , τ t 2 : t 3 -1 , · · · ) .

After executing a t + k , the paper queue is updated to include the newly found papers ( p 1 , p 2 , · · · , p n t + k ) . Since the Crawler will subsequently initiate new sessions to process these additional papers, their associated reward-to-go should be incorporated into the return estimate.

        "text": "a query q and a corresponding paper set P . Starting with a query q , the Crawler generates a trajectory τ = ( s 1 , a 1 , · · · , s T , a T ) . At each time step t , we denote the current paper queue as Q t . Upon taking action a t , the Crawler appends a set of new papers ( p 1 , p 2 , · · · , p n t ) to the paper queue. If a t = [Stop] , the set is empty.\n\nThe reward of executing action a t in state s t is defined as\n\nr ( s t , a t ) = α × n t ∑ i =1 I ( q, p i , t ) -c ( a t ) , (1)\n\nwhere I ( q, p i , t ) = 1 if p i matches the query q and is not already in Q t , and I ( q, p i , t ) = 0 otherwise.\n\nHere, α is a reward coefficient, and c ( a t ) is the cost of action a t .\n\nThe indicator function I ( q, p i , t ) can be determined by checking if p i belongs to P - Q t . However, it is important to note that the AutoScholarQuery may only include a subset of the groundtruth papers, as citations often emphasize a limited number of key references. If the Crawler receives rewards solely based on matching papers in AutoScholarQuery, this could lead to sparse rewards during training. To mitigate this, we use the Selector as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler. The revised definition of I ( q, p i , t ) is:\n\nI ( q, p i , t ) =      1 , if ( Selector ( q, p i ) = 1 or p i ∈ P ) and p i / ∈ Q t , 0 , otherwise. (2)\n\nHere Selector ( q, p i ) = 1 if paper p i is identified as correct to meet the query q by the Selector, and Selector ( q, p i ) = 0 otherwise.\n\nRL Training A key challenge in training the Crawler with RL is the significant time required to sample a complete trajectory for a given query. This is due to each [Search] or [Expand] action adding multiple papers to the paper list, resulting in hundreds or even thousands of papers in the final paper queue.\n\nTo address this issue, we define a session as a sub-trajectory that begins with a session's initial state and ends with the [Stop] action. We identify two types of session initial states: S q , which includes only a query, and S q + p , which consists of both a query and a paper.\n\nFormally, we model the Crawler as a policy π θ ( a t | s t ) . We partition the entire trajectory τ into a sequence of sessions: ( τ t 1 : t 2 -1 , τ t 2 : t 3 -1 , · · · ) . Each session is τ t i : t i +1 -1 = ( s t i , a t i , · · · , s t i +1 -1 , a t i +1 -1 ) , where the initial state s t i is either belonging to type S q or S q + p , and the final action a t i +1 -1 is [STOP] .\n\nSampling such a sub-trajectory from these session initial states is computationally efficient. During the PPO training, at time step t ∈ [ t i , t i +1 ) , we estimate the return in the session using Monte Carlo sampling:\n\nˆ R t = t i +1 -1 -t ∑ k =0 γ k 0 [ r ( s t + k , a t + k ) (3) + γ 1 n t + k ∑ j =1 ˆ V ϕ ( S q + p j ) -β · log π θ ( a t | s t ) π sft ( a t | s t ) ]\n\nHere, γ 0 is the in-session discount factor, and γ 1 is the across-session discount factor. ˆ V ϕ ( · ) is the value function model to approximate the state value. After executing a t + k , the paper queue is updated to include the newly found papers ( p 1 , p 2 , · · · , p n t + k ) . Since the Crawler will subsequently initiate new sessions to process these additional papers, their associated reward-to-go should be incorporated into the return estimate. In addition, we include a per-token KL penalty term from the learned policy π θ to the initial policy π sft obtained through imitation learning at each token to mitigate over-optimization. This term is scaled by the coefficient β .\n\nThen the advantage function can be approximated by\n\nˆ A ( s t , a t ) = ˆ R t -ˆ V ϕ ( s t ) . (4)\n\nFinally, the policy and value objectives can be given by\n\nL policy ( θ ) = E τ ' ∼ π old θ [ min ( π θ ( a t | s t ) π old θ ( a t | s t ) ˆ A ( s t , a t ) , (5) clip ( π θ ( a t | s t ) π old θ ( a t | s t ) , 1 -ϵ, 1 + ϵ ) ˆ A ( s t , a t ) ) ]\n\nand\n\nL value ( ϕ ) = E τ ' ∼ π old θ [ max ( ( ˆ R t -"

Building upon powerful LLMs [7, 88, 89], recent MLLMs [2, 15, 49, 56, 57, 63] have demonstrated exceptional multimodal understanding capabilities. Current research increasingly focuses on architectures that can simultaneously handle visual understanding and generation tasks. One approach extends MLLMs with pre-trained diffusion models [19, 25-27, 84, 97]. However, these systems essentially utilize diffusion models as external tools, where the MLLM generates conditions for image generation without possessing direct generative capabilities. This separation often results in suboptimal performance compared to standalone diffusion models [25, 84]. Another line of work [85, 93, 95, 96, 103] aim to train a single LLM for both tasks. Many of these methods employ vector-quantization [22, 83] to convert images into discrete tokens, enabling unified autoregressive processing [85, 93]. While straightforward to implement, these approaches are inherently limited by their image tokenization quality.\n\nOur work focuses on developing unified models that combine autoregressive capabilities with flow/diffusion models, leveraging their proven effectiveness in visual generation. Compared to similar approaches [96, 103], JanusFlow offers three key advantages: (i) a simple yet effective generation process using rectified flow, (ii) enhanced performance through decoupled vision encoders that resolve inter-task conflicts, and (iii) improved generation quality through representation alignment regularization, enabled by our decoupled encoder design.\n\n3. JanusFlow\n\nIn this section, we introduce the architecture of JanusFlow and our training strategies.\n\n3.1. Background\n\nMultimodal LLMs. Given a dataset D containing discrete token sequences, each of which can be formulated as 𝑥 = ( 𝑥 1, · · · , 𝑥 ℓ ) , large language models (LLMs) are trained to model the sequence distribution in an autoregressive manner,\n\nlog P 𝜃 𝐿𝐿𝑀 ( 𝑥 ) = ℓ -1 ∑︁ 𝑖 = 0 log P 𝜃 𝐿𝐿𝑀 ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 | 𝑥 1, . . . , 𝑥 𝑖 ) , (1)\n\nwhere 𝜃 𝐿𝐿𝑀 denotes the parameters of the LLM and ℓ is the sequence length. After being trained on large-scale datasets, LLMs exhibit the ability to generalize across various tasks and follow diverse instructions [1, 8, 68]. To extend these models to handle visual inputs, LLMs are augmented with vision encoders [2, 56, 57]. For instance, LLaVA [57] integrates an LLM with a pre-trained CLIP [73] image encoder via a projection layer, transforming the extracted image features into a joint embedding space that the LLM can process as word embeddings. By leveraging large-scale multimodal datasets and increasingly powerful LLMs, this architecture has facilitated the development of advanced multimodal models capable of addressing a wide range of vision-language tasks [4, 47, 56, 63].\n\nRectified Flow. For a dataset D consisting of continuous 𝑑 -dimensional data points 𝑥 = ( 𝑥 1, · · · , 𝑥 𝑑 ) drawn from an unknown data distribution 𝜋 1, rectified flow [55, 60] models the data distribution by learning an ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined over time 𝑡 ∈ [ 0, 1 ] :\n\nd 𝑧 𝑡 d 𝑡 = 𝑣 𝜃 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) , 𝑧 0 ∼ 𝜋 0, (2)\n\n<missing-text>\n\nwhere 𝜃 𝑁𝑁 represents the parameters of the velocity neural network and 𝜋 0 is a simple distribution, typically standard Gaussian noise N( 0, 𝐼 ) . The network is trained by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the neural velocity and the directions of linear paths connecting random points from 𝜋 0 and 𝜋 1,\n\nmin 𝜃 E 𝑡 ∼ P ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑧 0 ∼ 𝜋 0, 𝑥 ∼ 𝜋 1 h GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> 𝑣 𝜃 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) - ( 𝑥 -𝑧 0 ) GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> 2 i , where 𝑧 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑥 + ( 1 -𝑡 ) 𝑧 0. (3)\n\nHere, P ( 𝑡 ) is a distribution over time 𝑡 ∈ [ 0, 1 ] . When the network has sufficient capacity and the objective is perfectly minimized, the optimal velocity field 𝑣 𝜃 ∗ 𝑁𝑁 maps the elementary distribution 𝜋 0 to the true data distribution 𝜋 1. More precisely, the distribution of 𝑧 1 = ∫ 1 0 𝑣 𝜃 ∗ 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) d 𝑡 , with �\n######################\nOutput:",

Background\n\nMultimodal LLMs. Given a dataset D containing discrete token sequences, each of which can be formulated as 𝑥 = ( 𝑥 1, · · · , 𝑥 ℓ ) , large language models (LLMs) are trained to model the sequence distribution in an autoregressive manner,\n\nlog P 𝜃 𝐿𝐿𝑀 ( 𝑥 ) = ℓ -1 ∑︁ 𝑖 = 0 log P 𝜃 𝐿𝐿𝑀 ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 | 𝑥 1, . . . , 𝑥 𝑖 ) , (1)\n\nwhere 𝜃 𝐿𝐿𝑀 denotes the parameters of the LLM and ℓ is the sequence length. After being trained on large-scale datasets, LLMs exhibit the ability to generalize across various tasks and follow diverse instructions [1, 8, 68]. To extend these models to handle visual inputs, LLMs are augmented with vision encoders [2, 56, 57]. For instance, LLaVA [57] integrates an LLM with a pre-trained CLIP [73] image encoder via a projection layer, transforming the extracted image features into a joint embedding space that the LLM can process as word embeddings. By leveraging large-scale multimodal datasets and increasingly powerful LLMs, this architecture has facilitated the development of advanced multimodal models capable of addressing a wide range of vision-language tasks [4, 47, 56, 63].\n\nRectified Flow. For a dataset D consisting of continuous 𝑑 -dimensional data points 𝑥 = ( 𝑥 1, · · · , 𝑥 𝑑 ) drawn from an unknown data distribution 𝜋 1, rectified flow [55, 60] models the data distribution by learning an ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined over time 𝑡 ∈ [ 0, 1 ] :\n\nd 𝑧 𝑡 d 𝑡 = 𝑣 𝜃 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) , 𝑧 0 ∼ 𝜋 0, (2)\n\n<missing-text>\n\nwhere 𝜃 𝑁𝑁 represents the parameters of the velocity neural network and 𝜋 0 is a simple distribution, typically standard Gaussian noise N( 0, 𝐼 ) . The network is trained by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the neural velocity and the directions of linear paths connecting random points from 𝜋 0 and 𝜋 1,\n\nmin 𝜃 E 𝑡 ∼ P ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑧 0 ∼ 𝜋 0, 𝑥 ∼ 𝜋 1 h GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> 𝑣 𝜃 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) - ( 𝑥 -𝑧 0 ) GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> GLYPH<12> 2 i , where 𝑧 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑥 + ( 1 -𝑡 ) 𝑧 0. (3)\n\nHere, P ( 𝑡 ) is a distribution over time 𝑡 ∈ [ 0, 1 ] . When the network has sufficient capacity and the objective is perfectly minimized, the optimal velocity field 𝑣 𝜃 ∗ 𝑁𝑁 maps the elementary distribution 𝜋 0 to the true data distribution 𝜋 1. More precisely, the distribution of 𝑧 1 = ∫ 1 0 𝑣 𝜃 ∗ 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) d 𝑡 , with �"

We find that the impulse response functions are barely affected by this assumption. The reason is clear by inspecting the way capital returns enter the budget constraints of savers and hand-to-mouth consumers. The capital returns are multiplied by the transition probabilities ( 𝜆 𝐾,𝑆 and 𝜆 𝐾,𝐻 ), which are very small in our calibration. Therefore, while we observe some wealth effect in comparing Figures in the main text with the Figures below, we note that these appear to be of second-order importance.\n\n<missing-text>\n\nNote: All variables are expressed in real terms except for Hours, Inflation, and Nominal interest rate.

Empirically, increasing 𝑤 yields higher semantic alignment [23, 61, 71, 75]. Analogous to multimodal understanding, we prepend the special token |BOI| to indicate the start of image generation in the sequence.\n\nDecoupling Encoders for the Two Tasks. Previous approaches that unify autoregressive generation and diffusion models within a joint LLM training framework [96, 103] employ identical encoders ( 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 ) for both understanding and generation tasks. For instance, Zhou et al. [103] performs both tasks in the same VAE latent space using a shared U-Net or linear encoder, while Xie et al. [96] leverages MAGVIT-v2 [98] to encode image patches into discrete tokens for both tasks.\n\nHowever, recent work on unified autoregressive models has shown this shared encoder design to be suboptimal [93], particularly in models that generate images through autoregression on vector-quantized tokens. Drawing from these insights, JanusFlow adopts a decoupled encoder design. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained SigLIP-Large-Patch/16 [102] model as 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 to extract semantic continuous features for multimodal understanding, while using separate ConvNeXt blocks [92] initialized from scratch as 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 for generation, chosen for its effectiveness. Following established practices [5, 14, 90], we incorporate a long skip connection between 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 . Our controlled experiments in Sec. 4.5 demonstrate that this decoupled encoder design significantly improves the performance of our unified model. The complete architecture of JanusFlow is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\n3.3. Training Schemes\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, we train our model in three sequential stages, detailed below.\n\nStage 1: Adaptation of Randomly Initialized Components. In the first stage, we focus on training only the randomly initialized components: the linear layers, generation encoder, and\n\n<missing-text>\n\ngeneration decoder. This stage serves to adapt these new modules to work effectively with the pre-trained LLM and SigLIP encoder, essentially functioning as an initialization phase for the newly introduced components.\n\nStage 2: Unified Pre-Training. Following the adaptation stage, we train the entire model except for the visual encoder, consistent with previous approaches [57, 63]. The training incorporates three data types: multimodal understanding, image generation, and text-only data. We initially allocate a higher proportion of multimodal understanding data to establish the model's understanding capabilities. Subsequently, we increase the ratio of image generation data to accommodate the convergence requirements of diffusion-based models [18, 70].\n\nStage 3: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In the final stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained model using instruction tuning data, which comprises dialogues, task-specific conversations, and highquality text-conditioned image generation examples. During this stage, we also unfreeze the SigLIP encoder parameters [63, 87, 93]. This fine-tuning process enables the model to effectively respond to user instructions for both multimodal understanding and image generation tasks.\n\n3.4. Training Objective\n\nTraining JanusFlow involves two types of data, multimodal understanding data and image generation data. Both types of data contain two parts: 'condition' and 'response'. 'Condition' refers to the prompting of the tasks ( e . g ., text prompts in the task of generation and images in the task of understanding) while 'response' refers to the corresponding responses of the two tasks. The data can be formatted as 𝑥 = ( 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 , 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 ) , where the superscript 𝑐𝑜𝑛 denotes 'condition' and 𝑟𝑒𝑠 denotes 'response'. We denote the length of the whole sequence 𝑥 as ℓ , the length of 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 as ℓ 𝑐𝑜𝑛 and the length of 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 as ℓ 𝑟𝑒𝑠 . We use 𝜃 to represent the collection of all the trainable parameters in JanusFlow, including the LLM, 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 , 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 , 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 and the linear transformation layers.\n\nAutoregression Objective. For mutimodal understanding tasks, 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 contains only text tokens. JanusFlow is trained using the maximum likelihood principle,\n\nL 𝐴𝑅 ( 𝜃 ) = -E 𝑥 ∼D 𝑢𝑛𝑑 \" ℓ -1 ∑︁ 𝑖 = ℓ 𝑐𝑜𝑛 log P 𝜃 ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 | 𝑥 1, . . . , 𝑥 𝑖 ) # , (6)\n\n<missing-text>\n\nwhere the expectation is taken over all ( 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 , �\n######################\nOutput:",

Despite its conceptual simplicity, rectified flow has shown superior performance in various generative modeling tasks, including text-to-image generation [23], audio generation [40] and biological structure generation [38].\n\n3.2. A Unified Framework for Multimodal Understanding and Generation\n\nJanusFlow presents a unified framework designed to address both vision understanding and image generation tasks. Next we outline how JanusFlow handles these two tasks within a single LLM architecture.\n\nMultimodal Understanding. In multimodal understanding tasks, the LLM processes an input sequence consisting of interleaved text and image data. The text is tokenized into discrete tokens, each of which is transformed into an embedding of dimension 𝐷 𝑒𝑚𝑏 . For the images, an image encoder 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 encodes each image 𝑥 𝑖𝑚 into a feature map of shape 𝐻 𝑖𝑚 × 𝑊 𝑖𝑚 × 𝐷 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . This feature map is flattened and projected through a linear transformation layer into a sequence of embeddings with shape 𝐻 𝑖𝑚 𝑊 𝑖𝑚 × 𝐷 𝑒𝑚𝑏 . 𝐻 𝑖𝑚 and 𝑊 𝑖𝑚 are determined by the image encoder. The text and image embeddings are concatenated to form the input sequence to the LLM, which then autoregressively predicts the next tokens based on the input sequence of embeddings. According to common practice [85, 93, 96], we add special token |BOI| before the image and |EOI| after the image to help the model locate the image embeddings in the sequence.\n\nImage Generation. For image generation, our LLM takes a text sequence 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 as condition and generates a corresponding image using rectified flow. To improve computational efficiency, generation occurs in the latent space using a pre-trained SDXL-VAE [71].\n\nThe generation process begins by sampling Gaussian noise 𝑧 0 of shape 𝐻 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 × 𝑊 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 × 𝐷 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 in the latent space, which is then processed by a generation encoder 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 into a sequence of embeddings 𝐻 𝑔𝑒𝑛 𝑊 𝑔𝑒𝑛 × 𝐷 𝑒𝑚𝑏 . This sequence is concatenated with a time embedding representing the current time step 𝑡 ( 𝑡 = 0 at the beginning), resulting in a sequence of length 𝐻 𝑔𝑒𝑛 𝑊 𝑔𝑒𝑛 + 1. Unlike previous approaches that employ various attention masking strategies [96, 103], we found that causal attention suffices, as our preliminary experiments showed no performance benefits from alternative masking schemes. The LLM's output corresponding to 𝑧 0 is transformed back into the latent space by a generation decoder 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 , producing a velocity vector of shape 𝐻 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 × 𝑊 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 × 𝐷 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 . The state is updated by a standard Euler solver,\n\n𝑧 𝑡 + d 𝑡 = 𝑧 𝑡 + 𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) d 𝑡 , (4)\n\nwhere d 𝑡 is a user-defined step size. We replace 𝑧 0 with 𝑧 d 𝑡 on the input and iterate the process until we get 𝑧 1, which is then decoded into the final image by the VAE decoder. To enhance generation quality, we employ classifier-free guidance (CFG) when computing the velocity:\n\n𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑤𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 | 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 ) + ( 1 -𝑤 ) 𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 | ∅) , (5)\n\nwhere 𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 | ∅) denotes the velocity inferred without text conditioning and 𝑤 ⩾ 1 controls the magnitute of CFG. Empirically, increasing 𝑤 yields higher semantic alignment [23, 61, 71, 75]. Analogous to multimodal understanding, we prepend the special token |BOI| to indicate the start of image generation in the sequence.\n######################\nOutput:",

For image generation tasks, 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 consists of text tokens and 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 is the corresponding image. JanusFlow is trained with the rectified flow objective,\n\nL 𝑅𝐹 ( 𝜃 ) = E 𝑥 ∼D 𝑔𝑒𝑛 , 𝑡 ∼ P ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑧 0 ∼N( 0, 𝐼 ) h | | 𝑣 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 | 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 ) - ( 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 -𝑧 0 )|| 2 i , (7)\n\nwhere 𝑧 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 + ( 1 -𝑡 ) 𝑧 0. Following Stable Diffusion 3 [23], we set the time distribution P ( 𝑡 ) to the logit-normal distribution. To enable CFG inference, we randomly drop 10% of the text prompts in training.\n\nRepresentation Alignment Regularization. Recent work [99] has shown that aligning intermediate representations between diffusion transformers and semantic vision encoders enhances diffusion model generalization. Our decoupled vision encoder design enables efficient implementation of this alignment as a regularization term. Specifically, for generation tasks, we align features from the understanding encoder 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 with the LLM's intermediate features,\n\nL 𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴 ( 𝜃 , 𝜑 ) = -E 𝑥 ∼D 𝑔𝑒𝑛 GLYPH<2> sim GLYPH<0> stop\\_grad ( 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 ( 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 )) , ℎ 𝜑 ( 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 )) GLYPH<1> GLYPH<3> , (8)\n\nwhere 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) denotes an intermediate LLM representation given input 𝑧 𝑡 , and ℎ 𝜑 is a small trainable MLP that projects 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) to dimension 𝐷 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . The function sim (· , ·) computes the mean of element-wise cosine similarity between embeddings. Before computing the loss, we reshape ℎ 𝜑 ( 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 )) to 𝐻 𝑔𝑒𝑛 × 𝑊 𝑔𝑒𝑛 × 𝐷 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . To simplify the implementation, we intentionally adjust the configuration of 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 to ensure 𝐻 𝑔𝑒𝑛 = 𝐻 𝑖𝑚 and 𝑊 𝑔𝑒𝑛 = 𝑊 𝑖𝑚 . The gradient of L 𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴 is not back-propagated through the understanding encoder. This alignment loss helps the LLM's internal feature space (given noisy input 𝑧 𝑡 ) align with the understanding encoder's semantic feature space, thereby improving generation quality when producing images from new random noise and text conditions during inference.\n\nSummary. All three objectives are applied across all training stages. Multimodal understanding tasks use L 𝐴𝑅 , while image generation tasks employ the combined loss L 𝑅𝐹 +L 𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴 . Detailed experimental settings are provided in Sec. 4.1.\n\n4. Experiments\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the capabilities of JanusFlow in both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. First, we describe our experimental setup and implementation details. Then, we present results on standard benchmarks for multimodal understanding and image generation. Finally, we perform ablation studies to validate our key design choices.\n\n4.1. Experiment Setup and Implementation Details\n\nOur framework builds upon an enhanced version 1 of DeepSeek-LLM (1.3B) [7, 63]. The LLM consists of 24 transformer blocks and supports a sequence length of 4, 096. In our model, both understanding and generation exploits images of resolution 384.\n\nFor multimodal understanding, we leverage SigLIP-Large-Patch/16 [102] as 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . For image generation, we utilize the pre-trained SDXL-VAE [71] for its latent space. The generation encoder 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 comprises a 2 ×\n######################\nOutput:",

For image generation tasks, 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 consists of text tokens and 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 is the corresponding image. JanusFlow is trained with the rectified flow objective,\n\nL 𝑅𝐹 ( 𝜃 ) = E 𝑥 ∼D 𝑔𝑒𝑛 , 𝑡 ∼ P ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑧 0 ∼N( 0, 𝐼 ) h | | 𝑣 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑡 | 𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑛 ) - ( 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 -𝑧 0 )|| 2 i , (7)\n\nwhere 𝑧 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 + ( 1 -𝑡 ) 𝑧 0. Following Stable Diffusion 3 [23], we set the time distribution P ( 𝑡 ) to the logit-normal distribution. To enable CFG inference, we randomly drop 10% of the text prompts in training.\n\nRepresentation Alignment Regularization. Recent work [99] has shown that aligning intermediate representations between diffusion transformers and semantic vision encoders enhances diffusion model generalization. Our decoupled vision encoder design enables efficient implementation of this alignment as a regularization term. Specifically, for generation tasks, we align features from the understanding encoder 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 with the LLM's intermediate features,\n\nL 𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴 ( 𝜃 , 𝜑 ) = -E 𝑥 ∼D 𝑔𝑒𝑛 GLYPH<2> sim GLYPH<0> stop\\_grad ( 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 ( 𝑥 𝑟𝑒𝑠 )) , ℎ 𝜑 ( 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 )) GLYPH<1> GLYPH<3> , (8)\n\nwhere 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) denotes an intermediate LLM representation given input 𝑧 𝑡 , and ℎ 𝜑 is a small trainable MLP that projects 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) to dimension 𝐷 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . The function sim (· , ·) computes the mean of element-wise cosine similarity between embeddings. Before computing the loss, we reshape ℎ 𝜑 ( 𝑞 𝜃 ( 𝑧 𝑡 )) to 𝐻 𝑔𝑒𝑛 × 𝑊 𝑔𝑒𝑛 × 𝐷 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . To simplify the implementation, we intentionally adjust the configuration of 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 and 𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑐 to ensure 𝐻 𝑔𝑒𝑛 = 𝐻 𝑖𝑚 and 𝑊 𝑔𝑒𝑛 = 𝑊 𝑖𝑚 . The gradient of L 𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴 is not back-propagated through the understanding encoder. This alignment loss helps the LLM's internal feature space (given noisy input 𝑧 𝑡 ) align with the understanding encoder's semantic feature space, thereby improving generation quality when producing images from new random noise and text conditions during inference.\n\nSummary. All three objectives are applied across all training stages. Multimodal understanding tasks use L 𝐴𝑅 , while image generation tasks employ the combined loss L 𝑅𝐹 +L 𝑅𝐸𝑃𝐴 . Detailed experimental settings are provided in Sec. 4.1.\n\n4. Experiments\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the capabilities of JanusFlow in both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. First, we describe our experimental setup and implementation details. Then, we present results on standard benchmarks for multimodal understanding and image generation. Finally, we perform ablation studies to validate our key design choices.\n\n4.1. Experiment Setup and Implementation Details\n\nOur framework builds upon an enhanced version 1 of DeepSeek-LLM (1.3B) [7, 63]. The LLM consists of 24 transformer blocks and supports a sequence length of 4, 096. In our model, both understanding and generation exploits images of resolution 384.\n\nFor multimodal understanding, we leverage SigLIP-Large-Patch/16 [102] as 𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐 . For image generation, we utilize the pre-trained SDXL-VAE [71] for its latent space. The generation encoder 𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑐 comprises a 2 ×"
