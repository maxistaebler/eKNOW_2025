The input data provided does not contain any information regarding ByteDance Research or the PaSa Project, nor does it discuss potential safeguards for preventing exponential compute costs in real-world deployments related to token consumption. Therefore, I cannot support this claim with specific references from the given datasets.

Given the lack of relevant data, no actionable summary can be generated based on these records. More information would be needed regarding actual research papers or reports that provide details about such relationships and cost management strategies for real-world applications.
