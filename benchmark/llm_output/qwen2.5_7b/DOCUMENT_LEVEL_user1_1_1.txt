The use of automated rejection sampling in generating intermediate chain steps for tasks such as question answering or logical reasoning can indeed introduce a form of confirmation bias. This is because the algorithm might be more likely to select data that supports its existing hypotheses, while less supportive evidence may get rejected during the sampling process [Data: Reports (3)]. 

In contrast, human-annotated reasoning chains often involve a diverse set of perspectives and considerations. Humans can incorporate a broader range of information, including counterarguments and alternative viewpoints, which reduces the risk of confirmation bias. However, this approach also comes with its own limitations; human annotators might introduce biases based on their individual experiences and knowledge [Data: Reports (2, 4), Sources (1)].

This comparison highlights that both automated and human-annotated methods have unique strengths and weaknesses in terms of avoiding confirmation bias. Automated systems can be highly efficient but require careful design to mitigate sampling biases. Human annotators, while more flexible, must be mindful of their own potential biases [Data: Reports (2), Sources (1)].

In summary, the reliance on automated rejection sampling for intermediate chain generation may introduce confirmation bias due to its selective nature in data processing. This contrasts with human-annotated reasoning chains, which, despite being prone to personal biases, can offer a more holistic and diverse set of perspectives [Data: Reports (2, 4), Sources (1)].
