Based on the provided data, there is no specific mention of a system named CoRAG or any direct comparison between different retriever qualities like E5-base and E5-large. Therefore, it's not possible to directly draw conclusions about whether CoRAG compensates for weak retrievers rather than synergizing with strong ones.

However, we can infer some related information from the data tables:

1. **Relationships Between Systems:**
   - The "Relationships" table shows connections between various systems and researchers. For instance, HAI-LLM is described as a platform used for implementing large language models (L594), and AGILE is mentioned as a reinforcement learning framework (L7).
   
2. **Research Contributions:**
   - Researchers like Quoc V. Le, Pengcheng He, and others are noted for their contributions to the development of these systems.

3. **Framework Descriptions:**
   - The "Entities" table provides descriptions of different frameworks and techniques. For example:
     - AGILE is described as a reinforcement learning framework.
     - Relevance-aware retrieval is mentioned as a framework that can handle query understanding and ranking.
   
From this information, it appears that the focus is on developing robust systems and frameworks rather than explicitly comparing their performance under varying retriever conditions.

Given the absence of direct comparisons in the provided data, we cannot definitively state whether CoRAG compensates for weak retrievers or synergizes with strong ones. The data suggests a general trend towards comprehensive framework development but lacks specific experimental results to support such claims.

For a more definitive answer, one would need additional experimental data comparing performance under different retriever conditions for systems like CoRAG. 

**Markdown Response:**

If CoRAG's gains persist across retriever qualities (E5-base vs E5-large), it does not directly imply that the framework compensates for weak retrievers rather than synergizing with strong ones. The provided data focuses on general descriptions of frameworks and researchers' contributions, but lacks specific experimental comparisons. Thus, further empirical evidence is needed to draw such conclusions.

To gain insights into CoRAG's behavior under different retriever conditions, additional performance evaluation studies should be conducted. These studies could provide a clearer picture of how CoRAG performs across various retrieval strengths. 

This analysis highlights the need for more detailed experimental data and comparative evaluations to make definitive statements about framework performance and adaptability. **[Data: Relationships (18); Entities (594, 7)]**
